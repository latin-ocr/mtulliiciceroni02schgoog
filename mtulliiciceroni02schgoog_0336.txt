have atque or et rimmodi, so that eiusmodi would stand ior the subject,
which is quite contrary to usage.

155. 2. Nam mentem. We must supply some phrase like: idemque 2014
de reliquis dicendum est, to which narn relates, inasmuch as it clearly does
not introduce the reason oi the proposition immediately preceding. It is
here rather a particle oi transition; and the usage is in such cases to be
explained by supplying an intermediate clause in conformity with the con·
text So above c. 6, 15 3 ior further details see Hand Tursell. 111, 147.

155. 4. in nahtamat meunt ipsis. ct. the explanation in ΙΙ, 23, 61
and the note. ln regard to honos, salus and victoria the Stoic might Ι
have offered an answer, and lor Fortuna he would perhaps have said that
what appeared to men as inconstantia and temeritas was not really such,
but only an ἀνθρωπίνῳ λογισμῷ briniae ciria, according to Plut. De Plac.
Phil. I, 29 and Stobaeus Ecl. 1, p. 218.

ι 5 5. 20. Quid Veiovi facies? Festus answers this, p. 379: Ve 'syl-
labam rei parvae praeponebant, unde Veiovern parvum Iovem. Oi the
correctness ot' the answer we will say nothing ; but we see irom Ovid Fast.
ΙΙΙ, 445 that by Veiavis many people understood a small, youthiul Jupiter.
-The etymology oi Volcanus is found in isidorus, p. 1026, 32 Goth:
*dictus chanus quasi volans caradar, vel quari volicanus, quad per utrem
valet, which is at the least no worse than the most oi those given by Bal·
bus ΙΙ, 25-27, or than a recent one, which derives the name lrorn the
Greek, ‘Obnaioe= “draggiug the ioot,” because oi hle lameness. Com·
parative philology velers the name to a Sanscrit root utba, valka, which
means‘⁴⁴burning.”

155. 23. natare visus es=stuctuare, move hither and thither with·
out sure footing, titubare, “to be all adrilt.'’ Ci. Horat Sat. II, 7, bs
Pars multa natat, mado recta capessens, interdum pravis obnoxia.

155. 29. figurae deorumi divine ionns, in which the gods are enr- aa
bodied and live.

155. 30. Qut tantus error tuit. “The error oi deiiying natural oh· 25 ⁴
jecta went so iar.”-The deification oi Febris Cicero mentions and dis-
approves in De leg. I, ιι, 28, hut speaks only oi an altar; so in regard to
Mala Fortuna. Orbana is mentioned by 'tertullian ad. Nat. ΙΙ, 15 ns
a goddess, quae in orbitatem semina extinguat. But in that passage the
Mss. have Orbana.
