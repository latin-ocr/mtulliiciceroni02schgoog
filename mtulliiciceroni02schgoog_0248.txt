tabernaculam was not rite captum: see Lange, Rbm. Alterth. I, p. 4¹3·
Now Gracchus, after the first pitching of the tabernaculum, had occasion
to return to the city; but on repassing the pomerium he forgot to observe
the omens again as requIretl¹ by law; hence the tabernaculum was vitia
captum. Comp. De Div. 11, 17,Ι 33. ·-· [Schoemann reads [ad] 1101111111·-
pionis.] The preposition before hortas is wanting in the Mss.; some
have in kartas, which should then be torn or hortis ‚· (in nilla Scipionis
isfound in Granius Licin, p. 10, ed. Bona). Hortos cannot be taken as
apposition 1ο tabernaculum as has been proposed 3 it would be better to
strike out the words. [Baiter brackets them.]

given by Madvig that “it is good Latin to say medicina ars nan est, but
001 ars nulla, 00 sciense.” Mllller unsvers that ars medicina is perfectly
good (Varro L. L, ll, 933 Quint. XII, 11, 24, rei militariset rusticae ct
medicinae), i.e. he takes medicina as an adjective] ¹ ι

taken in the same* sense as in De Div. 1, 49, 110. ,Ι

“innate''; 101 the Stoics did not, any more than the Epicureansadmit the
existence of innate ideas. See above note 1,17, 44 and Plut. De Plac.

Cleanthes does 001 rnean to give a proper speculative proof of the existence Β

01 the gods3 but only to show the innasci, the natural origin of the belief
10 their existence. He therefore says, not argumentis or rationibus, but
causis, ie. occasions, for this is the proper idea of the word; hence the
phrase causam capere ,· and so in 5 14 when he says tertiam cansam, qnae
terreret animas fulminibus irc, the expression is strange, but not exactly
to be condemned. The occasion terrifies a man, in so far as it arises from
the terrifying phenornena of nature.
