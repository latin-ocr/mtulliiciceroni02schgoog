lour ol the chief forms os matter, the so-called lour elements, earth,
water, air and fire. Hence heat is to be regarded as the living
principle of the whole universe (²5·²3)· But this principle must
be conceived as possessing consciousness and reason. For since
there exists in all not simple, but composite natural bodies a supe·
rior governing power (ἡγεμονικόν), to which all the rest are subor-
dinate, so there must be a superior governing power in the uni-
verse3 and since some subordinate parts ol the universe are endowed
with reason, the superior parts must also be so endowed3 hence the
universe and this all-pervading‚ all-animating principle must be
endowed with reason, and the universe, since it is penetrated and
animated by this principle, must be a being endowed with reason,
divine and possesslng in lull divine power (29, 30). This principle
is then, as has been said, heat,¹ buta heat much purer, much more

¹ The principle ol heat in general, totum hargerus igneum as it is called in
ias, or calidum illud atque r'gneum (l 28), although operating in all the three
elements, earth, water and air, yet exists independently oi them as quarta pars
mundi or as a fourth element ln the aether (lap). Τὴε common earthly fire,
hic noster ignis, quem usus vitae requirit, ronsector consumptorque omnium
(541), appears on the contrary not as a separate dement, but only as a varia·
tion or inferior lorrn ol the other. According to Cicero then three grades are
to be distinguished ol this genus igneum first, the ardor caelestis, qur' aether
ve! caelum nominatur (lm), second, the vital heat in animals and planta
ignis corporeus (b 41), or hic noster calor, quo haec quae nota nobis sunt retinen·
tur et vigent (§30); third, the common lire which only burns, destroys, dis·
solves, consector, et consumptor omniurn (ἔῃ). ln other authors, as Stobaeus‚
Ecl. l, 36, p. 538, only two sorts are distinguished, πῦρ τεχνικόν aud πῦρ ἄτεχνον,
the latter being common lire, the former the two other sorts which Cicero dis·
tinguishes, which ln iact possess in common the animatlng and preserving

power. The Peripatetics blamed the Stolos lor using the one term πῦρ ol the
heavenly ether and ol common fire, though others had done the same before

them: they themselves rather regarded the ether as a separate existence, a
liith element in addition to the lour common ones. See Cic. Acad. 1, 11, 39:
Ps.Arist. de mund. c. a‚'5, with the citatione oi Kapp, p. 28; and ideler‚ note
on Arist. Meteor. Ι, p. 335. When, moieover, the Stoice laid down the propo,
sition that no lire can exist without replenishing as universally valid‚ so that it
might ‘be applied to the original hre irorn which all things have proceeded,
they certainly laid themselves open to the attacks ol their opponents: and we
> find that the Academia in Bk.111,14,37‚1mates use ol this to prove that the
original fire (or the primaeval deity ol the‘Stoics) cannot be eternal. We must

suppose that the Stoics really limited the proposition only to the varieties ol
