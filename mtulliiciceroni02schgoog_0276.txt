BOOK 11.-cnn.xxu,xx111‚ §3 56-61. 253

96. ²3· [neo carnutium δια, “neither leading a lite oi completeffiff
inactivity, as the Epicurean gods are represented to do, nor yet performing
their iunctions with a labor that is excessive or irksome.” Balbus alludes
Ι to the remarks oi Velleius in 1, 20, μ]

96. 29. monogrammos daos. Gods, who have only the outlines oi
a form, liniamentis dumtaxat extremis, as is said above 1, 44, 123. ln the
sarne way Lucilius called a pale and emaciated man, who was a mere
shadow, uix vivum hominem ac monogrammum. Nonius, p. 37 Merc.
Coma· above Ι, 18, 493 27, 75³ sset·

96. 34. [multae . . . naturae deorum. For the expression comp.
in the preceding chapter natura arandi, ceterae naturae,· De hin. 4, 7,
162 omnis uatrsra vult esse conservatrix sui. Below 2 3, 62 he says simply
Utilitatum igitur magnitudine constituti sunt ei di]

96. 35. uon alno causa. These words express a concession or recog· tto
nition. The Stoic does not reject the view in question, though he does not
undertake to establish it by reasoning‚ because that is impossible t'or him
to do. The universality of the view alone gives it a claim to recognition.
Although he only allows it to hold goodat first oi individuals, and those
the wisest, yet its universal acceptance proves to him tbat there must have
been an anticipation os it in the minds oi men.

97. 3. quod arai a deo natum. Comp. below ξ 62: qui utilitates
quasque gignebant: and De offic. 11, 5, 16: nulla tam detestabilis pestis
ert, quaenam houriui ab homine nascatur.

97. 4. nomlna ipatus dett so it is only by metonymy, the gitts being
called aiter the'givers, not themselves deified as many erroneously thought.
See nn„ 38 and 111, ιε, 41. Comp. Pluton oe Is. et orn. e. 70: ὥσπερ

“ ἡμεῖς τὸν ὠνούμενον βιβλία lliuiroooc dormiat φαμεν Πλάτωνα, rai Mt-

νανδρον ὑποκρὶνεσθαι τὸν τὰ Μενάνδρου ποιήματα ὕπονιθέμνον, οὕτως ἐκεῖνοι

. τοῖς τῶν θεῶν ὀνόμασι rd τῶν θεῶν δῶρα rai ποιήματα καλεῖν oiur ἐφείδοντο.

Also Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 11, p. 56.-The following verse is iram Terent.
Eun. IV, 5, 6.

97. 7. res ipsa. In detault oi a more definite expression Cicero makes at
nse oi the vague and general term res, a certain something wherein a
greater power is revealed‚ and in which a man, although he t'eels it within
himself, recognizes a giit or inspiration t'rom higher powers. Comp. c. 31,
79. ln most Mss. vis is found aiter ut ea ipra ,· evidently an error, as the
connection shows. Had Cicero thought it necessary to add a noun, he would
have used res: as immediately alter, ipsa res deorum. nomen obtinuit.

97. 9.¹ a M. Aemillo Soauro3 about nunc. 645, when he was censor.
Fides and Mens had temples in Rome beiore this, as Cicero immediately
says oi the tormer. A. Atilius Calatinus was consul 496 and 500, dictator
