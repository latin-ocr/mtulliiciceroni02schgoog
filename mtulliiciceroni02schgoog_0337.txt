st ¹5⁶· r. Neptunum esso diets nntmnm de. This refers to 11, 28, 71,
where the language differs, but the sense is the same. The phrase idem
do cerere is only a passing hint, which the reader is expected to complete
for himself.

156. 6. quails tu eos esso vis. After these words something has
evidently fallen out: non esse scio, or the like.

td 156.15. After Sed there isa long break, comprising the whole third
part of the argument, setting forth the objections against the divine provi·
dence, and a part of the fourth, against the particular care of the gods for
men3 all of which is lost.

The following llle traversa mento dvc. come from the same source and
correspond to vv. 371, 3989 of Euripides, although the translation in both
cases is not quite correct ΤΙιο remaining verses in ξς 66 and 67 have no
corresponding ones in the Medea of Euripides ς hut they may still have
existed in that of Ennius, inasmnch as the plays of the Roman dramatists
were not simple translations, but more or less free adaptatione of the Greek
originals.

also in De Orat. ΙΙΙ,Ι 58 and Tusc. 1v, 36.

Ι, 9, 73, divisse 11, 3, 169, and other similar examples in Lucretius. —The
succeeding verses Addo huo dc. refer to anothercrime of thyestes.
Atreus had received from Hermes a ram with golden wool, on the posses-
sion of which the duration of his authority depended. Thyestes with the

» aid of Adrope stole it.

tt 158. 1. videturne. Occasionally a question is introduced by the
simple enclitic ne where an affirmative answer is expected and nonne

' might be used in its place. Cf. De Offic. 111, 17, 68: suntne egitur insi·
diae, tendere plagas, and the remarks of Heusinger and Beier. Videsne?
Videtisne? are especially common. So in German Siehst du wohl f might
often be used for Siehst du nicht? See ΙΙ, 28 init, and below c. 34, 833
Tusc. 11, rr, 26 ; 21, 50³ aa, 53 ; Rosc. Am. c. 24, 663 Hand Turseli.
