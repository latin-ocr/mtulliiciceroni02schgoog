ens. Comp. Lobeclr Agl, p. 349 f. The fact that Orphic doctrines· are
several times mentioned in the extant writings of Aristode proves nothing
against the present passage; the name served as a convenient traditional
designation for certain theological views. The opinion here mentioned by y
Cicero was probably to be found ia the Dial. περὶ φιλοσοφίας. See Ber·
nays, Dialoge des Arist, p. 96.

Cercopsof whom we have no further information‚ was thought by some
(for example by Epigenes in περὶ τῆς εἷς Ὀρφέα ποιήσεως in Clem. ¹Alex.
Strom. 1, p. 397 Pott.) to be the author of two Orphic poems‚ the
(θησὲως) κατάβασις εἷς ridor, and the ἱερὸς λόγος. The latter, often called
in the plural ἱεροὶ λόγοι, consisted of twenty-four rhapsodies and con·
tained a very extended theogony; another, likewise called lepis λόγος,
was of ethic and ascetic character. ‘lbere was also aCercops from Miletus,
to whom a Hesiodic poem, higinius, was attributed; whether he was the·
same with the Pythagorean cannot be determined with certainty.

64. 33. Num eadem . . .omnla samplterna? Epicurus assumed 39
the existence of the infinite quantity of atoms only for the purpose of ex· ιω
plaining the assumed everlasting 'efflux of the impressions from the gods.
But Cotta speaks in this passage as if 'Epicurus intended to prove tbe
immortality of the gods from the inexhaustible mass of the atoms; and in
ξς 105-107 as if he used the 'ceaseless eillux of the divine images for the
same purpose. 'ibatis certainly an error or an intentional misrepresenta·
tion. . Epicurus first assumed the immortality of the gods on account o'f the
πρόληψις, and then tried to strengthen the belief by appealing to the law
of isonomy. According to this law, in contrast with mortal beings, there
must necessarily be immortal ones; and since all other beings of whom we
have knowledge are mortal and transitory, tbe gods are the only ones
remaining to whom we either can or must ascribe immortality. The argu·
ment may be awealr one; but it is better at any rate than that which Cotta
ascribed to him. For the following objections of Cotta see the note, Sum·
