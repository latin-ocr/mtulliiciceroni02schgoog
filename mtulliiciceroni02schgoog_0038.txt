nite number oi conserving sorces3 and in like manner that sor the great
number oi mortal beings there must be an equal number os immor-
tal beings; and we can imagine only the gods as corresponding to
this conception (ςο).Ι But it with the Stoics we suppose the uni-
verse itself to be God, or ii we accept the existence in the universe
oi a God that governs it, we only inflict upon the deity a burden and
a care, which isin¹ plain contradiction with the idea oi happiness Ι
(51, 52). Nor is there any need oi adivine ruler or creator oi the
world, since it has arisen from atoms by the force oi nature3 and
not only one, but innumerable worlds have come. are coming and
will continue to come into being in the same manner (53, 54). The
Stoic doctrine inflicts upon men rulers, os whom they must be in
continual dread3 it leads to a belief in a necessary fatality‚ in sootb·
saying and the like; from which the doctrine oi Epicurus makes
them free, and inspires them with reverence sor the gods without
- anv sear (ss‚5⁶)· '

After this exposition oi the Epicurean philosophy Cotta com·
mences his discourse in refutation oi it. He opens, aiter a few
compliments to Velleius, with the declaration, in conformity with the
principles os his school, that he is much more capable of detecting
, what is false, than oi ascertaining what is true3 and that he finds
himself, with respect to the question in debate‚ in the same position
with the poet Simonides, namely, that the longer he thinks on the
subject, the more obscure it seems to him (57-60). He is very iar
from disputing the existence of the. gods3 he believes in it heartily;
but isit be a question oi substituting sor this saith a knowledge
based upon logical prooi‚ he cannot allow the arguments adduced by·
Velleius to be convincing. For the circumstance adduced by Vel·
leius‚ that all men believe in the existence oi gods, is neither aproof

of that existence, nor itseli correct as a matter oi iact (61-64).
N or is he any more satisfied with what was said oi the essence and

lThe reversing oi the order oi these two propositions ln Cicero has led to
the misunderstanding that the gods are to be considered as the conservIng
iorces; which oi course would be ln direct contradiction with the view oi
Epicurus: ior this reason Zeller‚ Philus. d. Gn· ΙΙΙ, r, p. 240. n. 1, regards the
phrase about the conservlng and destroylng forces as an erroneous addition
oi Cicero's. But Cicero me'rely intended, aher giving the contrast between
mortni and immortal, to add that oi the destroyiug and conserviug forces, which
really underlies the other.
