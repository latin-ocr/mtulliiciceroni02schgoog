54. 3. tamquam Heraclitus. Cicero also hints tarther on in 111, 14,
25 that the obscurity oi Heraclitus, ior which he was called l σκοτεινάς, was
intentional; [De F in. 11, 5, 15]. This strange idea is found also in other
authors, asin Diog. L. IX, 6.- Quod iuter nos liceat. The fuller expres·

54. 19· Primum quidque, ‘¹ each one in its order ”3 that is, always tl
taking the object which ior the moment stands at tha head oi the others.
The proper explanation ot this osten misunderstood expression is given by
Giese, note to Cic. De Div. 1, 57, 127 ς and Madvig De Fin. note, p. 321.
