the murder of his colleague Drusus see c. 32, 80. Nothing more is known
of the poisoning of Metellus.

163. 1. Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily about 550, of whose 11
eruelty many incredihle stories are told, a part of which are evidently in·
ventions. He was finally put to death by the citizens of Ag'rigentum who
rose against hirn; the accounts vary as to the manner of his death. See
Beieron De Offic. ΙΙ, 7, 26.-Apollodorus, tyrant of Cassandrea, the
ancient Potidaea, lilrewise notorious for his cruelty, was put to death after
the taking of Cassandrea by Antigonus 1.—poenas sustulit, the more
unused expression, but used by Cicero also in Cat. Il, 13, 28 (poenam sui
sceleris sufferat) and Pro Font. c. 17, 39 (victoriae poenas sufflrre). Cf.
Nonius, p. 396. · ⁴

163. 4 Anaxarchus of Abdera had once dcepiy offended the Cyprian
tyrant Nicocreon in the presence of Alexander the Great; afterwards, when
Nicocreon had him in his power, he put him to death.

163. 6. zenonem of Elea (Velia). Cicero says of him in Tusc. 11,
22: perpessus est onrnia potius, quam conscios delendae tyrannidis indi·-
caret. The tyrant's name was Nearchus.

163. 9. Harpalum. The allusion is apparently to the 11610τί01111111111,ξέί

called by other authors Skirtalos or Shirpalos, into whose hands Diogenes
himself had once fallen.

16317. eum ad Peloponnesum classem appulisset. This is
evidently an error; nothing is known of an expedition of Dionysius to the
Poloponnesus. The occasion of the error was the surname Olympii, which
Cicero referred 1ο Olympia in siis. But there were temples of the Olym·
pian Jupiter in many other places, even in Syracuse where this story is
iocated by Aelian. V. Η., 1, ao.
¹ 163. 23. Epidauri. This is also an error, occasioned by the fact thatv
the Epidaurian temple of Aesculapius was the most noted. Valet. Max. 1,
1, 3, who agrees with Cicero, is no authority, as he only drew his informa·
tion from Cicero. According to Athenaeus XV, 693 Dionysius also robhed
the god of his table 3 the two stories arc about equally probabis.

164. 4. [111 [tyrannidis] rogum isthe reading of Baiter 11. &hoe-{45
