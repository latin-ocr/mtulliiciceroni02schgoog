is also stated by Pliny H. N. IX, 42, p. 6353 Plut. De Sollert. An. c. 303
and several other writers. According to modern naturalists however ibe
thing is very doubtful-pina oi the Mss. aster ntorsu must be stricken
out; morsu belongs to squillae.

118. 27. admirandum est, congressune dre. Mirari and admirari 124 Ι
not only express a feeling oi wonder, but include also the idea oi not under·
standing ,· and as this implies uncertainty, ignorance, both verbs may take
aiter them an indirect question. [Comp. English ‘⁸ 1 wonder whether ’⁸ dre.
admiratio in the next sentence is “matter ior admiration, wonder or per·
plexity.”]

118. 32. anitum ior anatum. See Lachmann on Lucret, p. 16. Ι

118. 34. exclusi totique is not 2 ὕστερον πρότερον; ior the jovere
continues more or less alter 1112 excludere, as Cicero himself says below c.

52, ¹29·

119. 3. platalea. This name occurs nowhere else. Pliny H. N. X, 49
40, p. 700 calls the bird platea and says thesaure oi it as Cicero does here.
Aristotle H. An. IX, 10 says oi a nelarie, that he throws. up the muscles
which he swallowed alive with the shells closed; and then as they are
dead and the shells are open he takes out the meat and leaves the shells.
It is the meat that Cicero here calls ea quaesunt esculenta· What Pliny
and Cicero tell oi the robbing ol the booty irom other birds is told by
modern naturalists oi 2 sort oi mew, the Leslrr's parasitica or Larus para·
silicea—Instead oi in quod ipsa Invaderet the Mss. have id quod,
evidently an error, because the relative sentence does not serve at all to
define the preceding captum. Comp. Sehoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, 337.

119. 9. Ranae marinae. The animal here meant is called by Pliny
H. N. IX, 42 rana pecarnis, ἁλιεὺς in Plut. d. Sollert. An. c. 27, and
Antig. Hist. Min, p. 74 West It is n'ot properly a frog, but 2 fish which
has some resemblance to 2 irog, now called Lonclus piscatorias. It has
on the head a pair oi thread-like prolongatioris with the ends rounded
which it makes useel as a sort ol bait. Comp. Oppian. Halieut. 11, 86.
[Moneri is used in the middle sense]

119. 13. illud.. .anlrnadversum‚ “the fact observed by Aristotle.”
-a quo pleraque sc. animadversa sunt. But this observationis not
lound in the extant worlrs oi Aristotle.

11919. ea ... adiuvatur, namely, when they liy with the wind
blowing irem behindr whereas the preceding air . . . adversus pellitur
refers to a flight against the wind, when the triangular form oi the flock
helps the ilight. Comp. Plut. ibid. c. 10.- What is said ol the birds in
