from Locri. The battle, which ended in the total defeat of the people of
Croto, took place about nc: 580. See Heyne‚ Opusc. Ac. ΙΙ, p. 1853 and
on the participation of the Dioslcnri see K1ansen,AEneas u. d. Penaten,
p. 666; and Preller, Rem. Myth, p. 659.

80. ιό. Faunorum, field and wood goda of a lower order, to whom
were ascribed all sorta of spectral apparitione and eries. Originally the
popular belief knew only one Faunus, who was said to have been king in
old times in Latium at a luter period there were many. Comp. De. Dis. .
Ι, 45, 101 ; and below 111, 6, ¹5·

ξ 8019. ea ostendi, foreas. Comp. note on c. ς, ις. lhe'Mas. add
quae sint or quae sunt or quaesutura sunt: evidently additions of persons
who were disturhed by th'e neuter of the pronoun. For hominibus, which
is plainly unnecessary, perhaps divinitus would be better. —The following
series of synonymous expressions is also found De Div. 1, 42, 93. It is dif-
ficnlt to distinguish the ideas clearly; but it may be said with Doederlein
(Synon. Part 5, p. 174), that prodigium expresses rnore particularly what is
significant and leads to important consequencess ostentum what iswonder·
ful and extraordinary ; portentum what is terrible and threatening; and
monstrum what is unnatural arrd ugly.—The'pronoun ssla has no granu
matical relation to the preceding ea,· it is rather to be explained itta quoe
nobis res suturas ostendunt dcc.

8ο.’ 2ο. [This phrase illa ostenta dre. is cited by Nigelsbach, Latein.
Stylistilc, ς 3, 2, b,' as a case where the want of an article in Latin is sup·

. plied by the demonstrative pronoun, equivalent here to Greek τά. ostenta

dcc. are then subjecte of dicuntur. Comp. Tnsc. V, 27, 78: Mulieres. . .

in certamen . . . veniunt. . .‚· quaeest victa, ea laeta prosequentibus suis

una cum viro in rogum imponitur, illa victa maesta discedit. But it

seems preferable to take itta as referring to praedictiones et praesensiones
with a change of gender like that of ea.]

80. 21. quodsi en ficta credimus. We should expect quae de Mopso
dcc. traduntur to follow ς instead of that Cicero witha freer turn of expres·
sion uses only the names—They are all names of famous seers of the
heroic age.

80. 24· sl red . . . repudiaret. Comp. Verr. Il, 5 ς, 138: ut, etiauui ’
domines tacerent, res tamen ipsa illum censum repudiaret.

80. 25. Ρ. Claudii (Pulchre) temeritas. The occurrence toolr
place nuc, 5055 the battle was near Drepanum against the Punic general
Adherbal.

ε 8ο. 30. lunius (L. Pullus). 'lhe'disuster happened near the pro·

montory Pachynum: his mistake was quod vitio reovegasset (Cic. De Div. I,

16, 29), he. contra auspicia, or avibus non addicentibus.
