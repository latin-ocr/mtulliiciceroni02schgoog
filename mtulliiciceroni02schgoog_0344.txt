agreed with the Stoic (11, 66), and that the sort of seli-confident reliance
on one's own strength and goodness which thinks to get 611 without the
help of the deity was an illusion that beeanoe more and more general after
the titue of the sophists, but was never the prevailing view 61 really classi·
cal antiquity. Of course it was understood that even the gods do not
make a man virtuous ’1111116111 61 against his will; he must meet them hail
11111, he 1111111 desire their aid and have the will on his part to codperate
in the work 61 virtue. ln this sense the poet says: ἐνμέσῳ 111161 κιχεῖν
. πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις 1111161 16161 (in Ciem. Alex. Strom. V, 12, 137); and this
is the idea of Plato Rep. X. 617 E: ἀρετὰ ἀδέσποτον, ἣν τιμῶν nal ἀτιμάζων
aleon nai 11611611 αὐτῆς inaures ἕξει· 6111611611161, θεὸς 6116111611 spassage

Roman custom of consecrating the tenth 61 one's gain 16 Hercules. See
Heindorf on Horace Sat. 11, 6, 103 Jahn 611 Persius 11, 11.

164. 35. Pythagoras. The story is told 61 several persons 3 accord·
ing 16 Diog. Laert. VIII, 12 the proposition discovered was the sis-called
problem of Pythagoras or magister matheseos. The doubt expressed by
Cotta is solved according to some by assuming that the ox vas only one of
dough. .

usage may be found in Ktihner’s Tusc. IV, 24. 53 note.

c. 34, 83.

of Diogenes the Cynic instead 61 Diagoras, Diog. L. VI, 59.

165.13. atque ei quidam amicus. The omission 61 the verbum
dicendi is not so violent ss to prove the passage necessarily corrupt. Cf.
F. A. Wolf Verm. Schr, pp. 159, 166. Tac. Hist. IV, 75: ad ea Cerialis
Civili et Classico nihil. The verb 161 nescio quid is also wanting above c. 5.
