years older than Cicero, was one of those who were accused of
nraa'estatis under the Lex Varia (see note on ΙΙΙ, 33, 81). He went ¹
into exile; but returned to Rome with Sulla in 672, where he was
madepontifex and consul in 679. In the latter office he carried a

Or. After his consulate he went to Gaul and succeeded in estab-
lishing a claim to the honor of a triumph, which was granted him,
he did not live to enjoy it, but died a few days before it was to hap-
pen. Ascon. in Pison., p. 14. He is very highly spoken of not
only for a most exact knowledge of philosophy, but also as an ora·
tor3 and even when a young man he had made a bold defence in
court of Rutilius, his maternal uncle (see note on III, 32, 80). He
was plainly in every respect a fitting representative of Cicero, who
takes for himself in the conversation only the part of aquiet listener.

Cicero represents these three men as assembied on one occasion
during the latin feast at the house of Cotta, probably in one of his
villas,-and as giving their various views about the nature of the
gods in a conversation, where he was himself present, as he hap·
pened to be visiting Cotta at the time. The date of this sup·
posed conversation must be placed between the year 679, the year
of Cotta's consulship, and 676, in which Cicero returned from a
, prolonged absence in Greece, where he had busied himself particu-
larly with philosophie studies3 and these are alluded to doubtless in
l,6,15.

The book opens with a dedication to M. Junius Brutus, after·
wards the murderer of Caesar,a man whose finished philosophical
culture and writings are often mentioned with the greatest deference
by Cicero, who was himself twenty-one years his senior. Euelltns
omnr'genere laudis, he says of him in Acad. Ι, 3, 12, sic phelosoplubm
latinis litteras persequitur, nihil ul uidem dr rebus Graecia desederet.
He professed the doctrines of the Academy of Antiochus, for which '
the note to l, 3, 6 may be consulted. We have none of his works
remaining3 but Seneca, Consul. ad Helv. c. 9, quotesa short passage
from his book De Virtute, and in epist. ,95 something from that
περὶ καθήκοντος (de officiis¹); but Quintilian, X, 1, 123, says that in

cites the book of Brutus De Patientia.
