treatise, considering the coincidence of several passages above
alluded to, but not quite certain3 for similar notices and opinions
doubtless occurred in many 'other Epicurean documenta)

The discourses assigned by Cicero to the Academic in the first
book against the Epicurean doctrine. and in the third book against the
Stoics. were without any doubt taken from one of the many writings
of Clitomachus. There existed no less than four hundred books of
this philosopher, in which he had made note of the oral teachings
of his master Carneades. But not only does Cicero himself several
times appeal to Carneades, but many of the arguments which he
makes against the Stoics are found in the same form in Sextus Em·
piricus in the ninth book of the treatise against the mathematicians,
aie.. against the dogmatics. and they are there ascribed to Carneades.
Although they are in part evidently sophisticah they are still in gen·
eral well adapted to prove what Cicero makes Cotta say, that there
is a great difference between religious saith and scientific knowledge;
that faith' rests upon something different from dialectis argument,
and that whoever seeks to found it upon such runs the risk rather of
weakening it. But we may well suppose that many among the
ancients were reasonable enough to see with Cotta that faitlritself
was not overthrown by the refutation of insufficient rational grounds(
and( that there was such a thing as an immediate certainty of faith,
independent of the strength or weakness of logical arguments.2

1 This is also the opinion of the reviewer of the Herculanensia, published by
Drummond and Walpole (Imnd0n‚1810)‚in the Quarterly Review, Vol. 111,
No. 5, p. ις.

²A te enim philosopho rationem accepere debeo religionis, maioribus ctiam
nulla ratione reddita credere says ‘Cotta 111, a, 6. Now it is of course beyond
all doubt that it was utterly impossible for a thinking man at that time really to
hold such a position toward all the tenets of the traditional religion of the
people as Cotta in this passage professes himself to hold, and that much, per·
haps the most of it, was professed only for political reasons as a means to any
thing but religious ends ς but still it would not be just for this reason utterly
to deny to the thinkers of those times any religious faith whatever, as has in faut
been done. “What is more unworthy of a philosopher than to deny the exist·
enee of the gods?'' says Cotta 111, 17, 44 ς and he was certainly sincere. But
the appeal to the tradition handed down from the forefathers indicates in gen-
eral a consciousness that a real ktcowledge of divine things is impossible for anan,
and that therefore religion, which as a matter of fact was everywhere existent,
must have some other source than knowledge. lt is not to be woudered at
