8 DE NATURA DEORUM.

found at the end of the Summary of the first book.

The Stoics maintained a very different attitude towards the popu·
lar belies; toa certain degree at least they undertook to support
and defend it. They distinguished at the outset a threefold the·
ology: the litical, the mythical or poetical, and the philosophica
offhygical) By the first they understood the religious ordinances
recognized in the various states, and placed under the control of the
public authority; that is, the traditional or legally established regu·
latinns about the deities to be worshipped in the state, and the

manner os paying this worship. The second head comprised the Α

fables recounted by the poets of the gods and their doings. So
far as these pretended to be narratives os actual events, they were
entirely rejected by the Stoics as being equally destitute of external
or internal truth3 that is, they neither contained any basis of fact,
nor were they in harmony with the nature of the gods. Of course
they thought they discovered a kernel of truth in many fables, a

physical or ethical proposition under a mythical form, but certainly , ,

not in all; and they disapproved in general of the mythical lorm ol
treatment of these subjects, because few persons understood it, 3ηά
the majority were misled by it into false and perverted conceptions
of the gods. They thought, however, to find the key to the under·
standing of the most important sables in the third part, the physical
or philosophie theology; this¹ not only undertook to prove in gen-
eral the existence of divine beings and a divine order and govern-
ment of the world, but also recognized the deities proposed by the
political theology as objects oi worship3 and although not repre·
senting this recognition as necessary, it at least sought to justiiy
it as reasonable and probable. As the chief heads os this physical
theology of the Stoics are contained in Cicero's second book, and
are grouped together in the Summary of that book, we may refer to
that ior the details, adding however here a few observatione.

lt is customary to call the theology of the Stoics pantherinm and
it isso in so lar that it places the deity in the world, and regards it
as coextensive with 3ηά pervading all its parts. The deity oi the
