Δ 51. ao. 1101011111. “plenum et inane dixit esse, ande omnia gugne-
rentur.” Cic. Acad. II, 37, 118. , The plenum, παμπληθές, was an inlinity

you take) to give up being an Epicurean ?” Comp. De Fin. 11, 22, 741

52. 2. nulla moderante natura. This contradicts what Velleius
said above, c. 20, 53. But in a certain degree both are 11110. The atoma
in moving perpendicularly downwerd plainly obey a law of neture; but
they vary from this direction without a specifrc law, and it is only by virtue
of this variation 11111 the origin of the world is possible. See note to c.
25, 69.

hence hard to controvert. This is shown in the following chapter by two

consists of atoms, if the atoms had no power of varying from the course
prescribed by the law of nature, all the activities of the mind must follow
the law of nature, and free will would be excluded. For this reason Epi·

curus conceded 1ο the atoms a certain power of voluntary motion, which
enabled him, he thought, to explain by the concurrence of the atoms thus
varying from the perpendicular line both the origin of the universe and

¹ the freedom of the human will. Comp. Cic. De Fato, 0. 10, 223 and
especially Lucret. II, 217ff. and 251 ff.

52. 21. qnod Democritum fugerat, because Democritus had
assumed not a perpendicular motion with 1 voluntary deviation, but a
whirling motion inherent in the nature of the atoms and taking place of
necessity. Diog. L. IX, 45 r πάντα τε κατ’ ἀνάγκην γενέσθαι τῆς δίνης dirior
obem rh( γενέσεως nomem, tv ἀνάγκην λέγει, 500 De Fin. 1, 6, 18.

c. 10, 21 ; and Acad. ll, 30, 97 where the same thing is said of Epicurus 3
