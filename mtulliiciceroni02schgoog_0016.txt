means of supplying this delect satisfactorily¹ 3 a lew general remarks
however, lor which there was no room in the notes, may not be out
of place here.

The earliest speculation ol the Greeks, if it deserves the name, on ·
the origin os the world and the forces that formed it coincides at least
partially with the ideas which we find more or less plainly indicated

' in the oldest poetry ol Homer and Hesiod. The primaeval water ol ,

Thales may be recognized in the Homeric Oceanus, the origin ol all
things; and the primaeval air ol Anaximenes may correspond to
the Hesiodic Chaos! But the popular religion ol the Greeks lclt
the origin ol things quite out ol consideration3 and, taking for
granted the existence of the universe and of the gods, insisted only
upon reverence to the gods as exercising the government ol the
world and presiding over human life, each in his own sphere and

office. No one of the older philosophers thought it necessary to
contradict this saith in general, although they might not have been
led to it by their own speculations. They either left it to stand
upon its own merits, or felt its influence so strongly as to recognize
it, and so to keep religion and speculation separate. Although they

criticised certain popular and mythological conceptions, and some·
times incurred opposition and persecution for so doing,³ yet on the
whole we‘hear very little ol any aggressive contradiction on their
part, or even of remarks implying indifference or disparagement.
The reason is, that as there were no religious dogmas or doctrine
authorized and protected by the state or the priesthood, the ritual
worship was the only thing established and inviolable; this simply

ol the history ol ancient philosophy to se'e how the scanty and unreliable state·
ments ol later writers,¹ which are our only source ol knowledge, have been
differently understood and explained by one or another; so that the pretended
results'are not tmlrequently very wide apart in the most important points: while¹
very little remains that is generally accepted as true. For this reason it has
been thought best not to reler in this commentary to any particular historian ol
ancient philosophy as a reliable guide.
