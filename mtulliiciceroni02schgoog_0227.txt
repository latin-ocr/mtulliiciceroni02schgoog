57. 7. ipsum sibl displicere. tibi would have been more exact;
but what precedes really applies not so much to Velleius, as to the Epicu·
reans in general.

[Haec vestra sunt. .'lhere seems to be something wrong here.
Cotta has just finished his refutation oi the Epicurean doctrine that the gods
have human forms, he asks, l. 7, An tu mei similem putas esse aut tui
deum? andanswers himself, Profecto non putas. He then asks, Quid
ergot-do you think the sun and moon are gods? and shows this to be
absurd. Then according to the common reading he says, Haec vestra sunt.
But these doctrines last mentioned are not Epicurean doctrines, vestro, ie.
01 Velleius and his sect. Then in the next sentence he goes on 1 11 they
have not human forms, as Ι have shown, nor any such 101111 (tali aliquo),
which you are quite certain 01 irc. The words nec tali aliquo refer to
sotem aut tunam aut coelam,- but they must retes 10 some view which Vel·
leius did not accept as true 3 and the words Haec vestra sunt state the con·
trary 01 what would be expected. Possibly they should be a question; 01
is the reading 01 the Ms. l (ed. Moser) the true one, Haec vera sunt?]· ’

57.12. humano (vtsu)=tumana specie. As the Mss. here have 1
break, the word to be inserted is by no means sure ; it might be corpore.
But the emendation venerantes ior numerantes is certain.

57.17. ltaque &c lt is clear that the simple quotation in this sen-
tence is not properly that which is to serve as prooi 01 the view just men·
tioned in the preceding, but that such prooi consists in the supposed
intentional ambiguity 01 Epicurus, which is afterwards spoken 01. This
connection 01 thought would have been more properly expressed as tol-
lows: Itaque cuns in illis selectis eius brevibusque sententiis . . . prima
sententia sit. . . in hac ito exposita sententia iro-On the rip. 111111
