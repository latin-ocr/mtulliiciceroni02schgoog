Eumenides? quae si deae sunt, quarum . . . lucus Furinae, Furiae deae
runt dte. We have given in the text the emendation of Madvig, adopted
by Baiter 1 and 11. Schoemann in his Appendix does not venture to adopt
this because it differs too much from the Mss. reading; and thinks that by
placing a colon after Furinae the difficulties are removed. (We omit this
note in the Appendix.) The common text gives this sense: 1f the Eume·
nides are deities, the Furies are also deifica-which though true is not
important. Madvlg’s emendation is only away of untying the knot, but at
least gives a reasonable sense]

150.28. lucus Furinae. Plutarch C. Gracch. c. 17 calla this ᾰλσος
Ἐριννύων, from which it appears that he took the same view with (icero in
regard to this deity 3 who according to Varro 1. L.. V, 84 was little known,
although there wasaFlamen Furinalis andafeast Furinalis. ⁴

150. 30. narro only occurs here; and the form of the name, whether 47
Nescio or Natio, is doubtful. Tire fact that the Romans paid worship to
her in the territory of Ardea would show that she was a deity especially
belonging to Ardea3 possibly the same that Strabo V, 3, p. 376 calls
Aphrodite 3 after Ardea became a part of the Roman state the Romans
also joined in her worship, as they usually did in the various religious oh·
servances of annexed states. ¹

150. 35. Moneta appears in this connection as an especial deity, cor·
responding to the Greek Mnemosyne, which is translated in the same way
hy others also; whereas in other places and in Cicero himself, De Div. l,
45, 105, Moneta is a title of Juno, “the warning one,” which she is said to
have received on a special occasion. Aa the mint was near her temple it
was called after her, efficiare Monetae ,⁰ aee Liv. Vl, ao, 133 and her title
was transferred to coined money.

151. 3. Serapim Isimque. The worship of there Egyptian deities 11
had found entrance into Rome as early as the sixth century of the city
(Valer. Max. 1, 3, ς), and although it was repeatedly forbidden under pen·
alty it constantly reappeared, until at length it was tolerated and after the
beginning of the eighth century publicly recognized. See Orelli ad Arnoh. ,
11, 73 31Preller Rdm. Myth, p. 7²7 and Regionen der Stadt Rom, p. 123.
The prohibition of the worship of foreign deities did not rest upon a de·
nial of their existence, bnt rather on the opinion that certain deities and
religione were fitted for some nations but not for others.

151.12. coloni nostrl Circeiensem Circeii in the Volscian terri-18
tory possessed the ius Latii as early as the time of the elder Tarquin.
According to Westphal (Die Rdm. Campagna, p. 60) the common people
of that region preserve to this day a reminiscence of the Circe whose tem·
ple Strabo mentions at Circeii (V, 3, p. 232).
