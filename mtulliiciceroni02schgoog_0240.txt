67. 26. Quibus expnoatIs irc. Τ1ιιι ιι, the deeds ιιι(1 experiences
oi the gods, set forth m the mysteries, have an allegorical significatione
is you bring them down to their 'true meaning (ad rationem revocatis),
yon recognize in the gods the powers οι nature peraonified, and m their
actions and experiences natural events. Tuis was the view oi thinking
minds; but we cannot believe thnt the priests themselves gave explana·
tions oi that sort to those initiated m the mysteries. —Gomp besides the

67 30. Tum enim censet ‚Soiaraswe can assertam the theo·
logical views oi Democritus, he held iirst the existence oi ι divine snb-
stance pervading the whole· universe, consisting oi special atoms oi the

most subtle constitution. This is the ueta nicia in Clem. Alex. Strom. V,
5 88, p. 698 Pon.. and the κόσμου ψυχή in Plutarch Ploc. Phil. I, 7. From
this substance proceed not only the individual gods but alsothe souis oi
living heings, which by breathing constantly receive as nourishment par·
ticles oi this same substance which pervadas the air. Arist. De Resp. c. 4.
It is this substance doubtless which Cicero here means by principe‘a mentis,
and which above also c. 12, 29 he intends by natura quae imagines fundat.
For from this proceed the divine iorms called aldoin on account oi their
subtle, etherial constitution quite different irom the coarser corporeal forme

imagines, quae vel prodesse nobis soleant vel nocere ,· and likewise without
doubt the imagines divinitate praeditae mentioned ln the beginning oi the
passage. But the last-mentioned ingentes imagines, which embrace the
whole universe irom without, are not alludcd to in this shape by any other

author, and probably are the resulto( a misunderstanding.
