it. On the other hand what Cicero, expresses by omsita is called iu estro·
nomical language conjunction, σύνοδος, when moon sud sun stand near
each other in the heavens, the moon being between the earth and the sun,
and in regard to us before the sun, opposita, or sometimes just under it,
supposita, in which case a total or partial eclipse results. 'l'bales under·
stood the causes ol the eclipses oi the sun and moon so well that he was
able to predict one oi the sun.¹ See Diog. L. I, 23 with the remark oi ,
Menage. But th‘u isdoubted by more recent writers on the history ot'
astronomy. See Philol.XX11,p. 550.

ιιι. 5. Aratum os Soli in Cilicia, rac. 275, wrote a diductio poem in 41
two parts, Φαινόμενα, “phenomena oi the stem,” and Διοσημτῖα (timulsti),
“ signs oi the westher ”3 it was translated by Cicero, and again by Caesar
Germanicus, ie. Domitian, not as has been supposed by the son oi Drusus,
adopted son oi Tiberius. Of Cicero’s translation we have only fragments,
though oi considerable extent; οἱ that oi Germanicus the first part is com·
plete, oi the second only a couple oi verses remain. Resides these there is
ar translation oi Rufus Festus Avienus ot‘the fourth century much more
free than those oi (icero or Domitiam hut these last even, like all the an·
cient translatore, did not consider such exactuess necessary as is nowadsys
required in a translator.

the axis mound which the universe revolves two-told (this he did not find
in Aratus), because he imagines it as divided into two parts by the earth,
which lies in the middle oi the universe, and through which the axis neces-
sarily passes. -lhe pole which he has in mind is the North pole, the only
one visible to us. .

ιιι. 17. cynosura, the little bear, properly only the polar star, then
the whole constellation; Helice, the great bear, also called the septem
triones, the seven plough oxen, or in the singular septentrio ou account of
the seven very bright stars which compose it3 this name was then also
given to the lesser bear, the Cynosura. See c. 43, nt and Heyne on Vtrg.
