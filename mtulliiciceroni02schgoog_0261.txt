18 92. 32. noll prae te forro, “don’t make a parade” as ii it were
something to boast of, and not rather to be ashamed oi.

92· 34. [Novum etlam oculorum judicium, ie. your sense of sight
seems to be differently constituted from that ot other people, as well as your
mental judgment.]

9²· 35. Sed sint teta pulchriora... The contrast to this conces·
sion does not corne until 5 48, and then in a different torm. Except ior the
intermediate sentences Cicero would have continued somewhat thus: iliud
tamen certe manifestum est, hanc aequabilitatem matus dac.

guage seems to indicate that globus in the mathematical signification was
not yet generally in use in Cicero's time. He uses it ior the heaveuly
spheres in Somn. Scip. c. 43 ot' the earth ibid. c. 6 and Tusc. 1, 28, 69.
Originally it meant only a ‘⁴ lump,” aldn to glomus, as Priscian 1, 8, 44 re·
marks. Seneca Quaest. Nat. IV, ιι and often in other places, as well as
Pliny several times, uses pila in speaking οἱ the earth.

93. 8. a medioque tantundem absit dec. [Schoemann has the
old reading a mediaque tantum absit extremum, quantum idem a summo:
qua nihil &c.; and wrestles with it in the following note] The extreme
(extremum) ot the sphere or circle is the whole surtace or circumference3
and it one were to specify any point as the “highest'’ (summum), this
