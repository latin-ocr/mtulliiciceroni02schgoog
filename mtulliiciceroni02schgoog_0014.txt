INTRODUCTION.

—000—

CICERO’S essay on the nature of the gods is at once our most
accessible and most complete original authority on the theology
of the ancients3 it gives us a briel outline of the views ol the older
thinkers and a complete exposition ol the doctrines of those schools
ol philosophy which in later times included the greater number of
educated people. The reader will'perhaps be better able to under·
stand the book alter a lew introductory remarks on the ancient the·
ology and its various schools.

The philosophy of religion has to deal with the most important
questions which can occupy the human mind. These regard the
existence and nature ol those unseen powers which are lelt by man
to control both his own inner and outer lile, and the visible world
about him. There is one answer ever ready sor these questions:
religion, older than any philosophy, offers a body of more or less
definite conceptions which constitute the popular laith3 and this
saith is realized in the public worship and in the whole religious tone
of the people. But in this as in all other matters there comes a
time in the intellectual development ol all nations when the more
advanced minds feel a need, which is the beginning and end ol all
philosophy, the need ol positive knowledge. People are no longer
ableto accept the traditions of religion upon, mere saith, they ask
lor the reason ol saith, lor the ground ol the prevailing ideas3 and
it religion cannot make good its claims by appeal to a higher
authority, to a divine revelation, and thus raise its domain above
all doubt or cavil (a thing which the religious ol antiquity neither
were able nor pretended to do), the necessary consequence is that
reason makes an attempt to lind an answer to these questions in
her own way3 and she then concedes the truth of the traditional
saith only in so lar as it coincides with or at least does not contra-

dict her own conclusions.
