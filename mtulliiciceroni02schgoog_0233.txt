22, 11 vereor 111 nihil coniectura aberrem. With aberrare os course·
a vero, a proposito is to be supplied. Α complete misunderstanding os the
expression has occasioned the placing ol the prepositiona before con·
iectura ,· and one must then imagine that coniectura can mean tte very
trutlr 111111 is sougit asten· ss the latest desender ol this opinion says,
‘⁴ coniectura cum effectu ” or “finis quo tendimus.”

6218. [6161116611 quldem 816, “And oi a bearded Jupiter lor·
sooth” 816. This is represented to be quite as certain as what precedes, and
with a view oi weakeningor destroying its sorce as au argument. See
Schwarz on Hor. Turseli, p. 284, Jahn on Cicero Or. 6. 50,168; and
especially Madvig Emend. iu Cic. Libr. Phil, p. 91.

1⁰1 62. 24. ob aliquam utllltatem. An assertion osten made, but
hardly correct, at leust in this general form. The worship ol auimals is a
sort of letishism, testing upon a vague feeling of a superhuman power oi
nature as displayed in them, which man in an uncultivated state wonders
at and reveres. In Plut. De Is. et Osir. c.,74 the συμβολικόν is placed
along side ol the χρειῶδες; and in c. 77 auimals are called αἰνίγματα τοῦ
θεοῦ. Comp. the learned remarks ol J. A. Kanne in the Introduction to
his hlytbologie der Griechen, and Duncker, Geschichte des Alterthums 1,
p. 53, ad edition. ’
⁴ 62. 28. volucris anguls. Other authors make the same statement,
but derive the winged serpents in part not stom Lybia but stom Arabia,
asHerod.11,75; ΙΙΙ, 1073 Ammian. Marcell. XXII, 15, 26. Schneider
on AElian. ΙΙ. An. II, 38 isos the opinion that the creatures in question are
flying lizards (the draco volans os Linnaeus). The whole matter is doubt·
less exaggerated end sabulous.

62. 28. vento Atrlco. For the Italians the Africus isthe West south·
West wind, ab occidente hiberno, qur* apud Graecos λίψ dicitur (Seneca
Quaest. Nat. V, 16), because it came to thern from the province Africa.
Here it must be a West wind, as Lybia lay in this direction from the
Egyptians.

62. 32· tamon beluus 816. The connection of the sentences shows
that this is the true construction, not concludam tamen, because ita conclu·
dant 816. is not opposed 1ο, but rather follows from what goes besore;
Cotta concludes thus, not although, but because he wishes to be briei. The
tamen points to a thought not expressly stated because easily supplied from
the connection, as often occurs in conversational style: Although people
laugh at the Egyptians ior their worship ol animals, yet the animals (and
this by way of excuse) are not considered sacred without some reason.-
