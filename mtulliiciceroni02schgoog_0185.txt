172 noras.

The latin seems to have had uo single word to express the vegetable king·
dom. Cicero uses several circumlocutions; Il, 33, 83: eaquae a terra
stirpibus continentum· ΙΙ, 10, 28: eoquorum stirpes terro continentum·
De Fin. IV, 5, 13: res eae quoegagnuutur e terra ,· N. D. ΙΙ, ι 3, 362 stirpes
aloue; Sallust Jug. 70, 6: gignentia. See Nigelsbach, lateinische Stilis·
tik,§36, 1, 2.]
33. 29. quae dicentur tn hts libris. See ΙΙ, 62, 156 sequ—ea
ipsa, these things exactly as they are.
33. 30. fabricati paene, ie. paene fabrili opera effecisse, with
artistic plan aud care.
33. 31. Carneades oi Cyrene, head oi the Academy at Athens about
. the middle oi the second century tae. His negative criticism, on which it
may suffice lor the moment to reier to c. 5, 11, was directed especially
against the Stoics and their leader Chrysippus. Comparealso ΙΙ, 65, 162
and 111,17,44. He wrote nothing except some letters to the Cappadociam
king Ariarthes, but his lectures were reported by listeners and published.
33. 31. lta goes with disseruit, not with multa ,¹ it points to the char·
acter oi his arguments, which were such ut excitaret (sc. Carneades)
homiues &a For the arrangement ol the words compare Verr. ΙΙ, 3, 8:
magistratuum nostrorum iniurias ito multorum tulerunt, ut numquam
ante hoc ternpus ad oram legum . . . confugerint.

8 34. 1. Qua quidam in causa. The idea mayhe better defined by

⁶ mentally supplying tractanda. Cicero says: While undertaking this dis·
cussion 1 am quite in a position to defend myseli *irom any one who
blames me ior it.—lt is entirely erroneous to reier this expression, as
many have done, to the Stoics and Epicuream.

34. 2. [benivolos. So Miiller writes here, and in Ι, ar, 585 44, 122
irum the Mss. Both bene· and beni· are correct, but the lormer became
the recognized torm lrom the first century oi the empire. Brambach]

Β 34. 6. [brovttempore edidimus. See Introduction, p. ¹9·]

34. ιο. eam . . . philosophiam, ie. Academicum. In Acad. ΙΙ, 19,
61 Cicero represents Lucullus as saying to him: Tune eam philosophiam
sequere, quoe confundit vera cum salsis, spoliat nos iudicio, privat appro-
batione, omnibus orbat sensibusi-He dative rebus is not to be taken
with iucem eriperet on account ot' the order oi the words3 we might rather
supply a dative like nobis or hominibus. Compare Acad. ΙΙ, ιο, 30: quid
eum facturum putem de obditis rebus et obscuris, qui iucem erepere conetur?
ibid. 32, 105: nou enim lucem eripimus .· sed ea, quae vos percipi, eadem
nos videri dicimus: and 103: ab Academia seusus eripi. Compare Liv. X,
32: nebula erat-densa adeo, ut lueis usura eriperet.
