Stoioe is not a purely spiritual, immaterial being3 it is at once
matter and spirit inseparably united. But this spiritual and ma·
terial essence manifested itself in the creation ol the world in
such away that two modes of its activity may be distinguished.
Its material essence, represented as the finest, lire-like ether,con·
densed itsell in part to a coarser nature, and thus arose the matter
nithe world, the ὕλη, at first only an ἄποιος οὐσία with no definitely

different elements, from the continual action ol which each on the
other, under the influence os the law implanted in them by the origi-
nal divine being, a well ordered whole, the κόσμος, the universe
proceeded. The universe is thus an emanation from the deity, the
connection between the two still ol course subsisting. We may

soul. But we must not be misled into considering ¹the deity only as
the ,soul ol the universe, it is rather onlya part of the original deity
that is embodied in the universe‘3 the deity does not itself lor that

grosser stuff encircles the world that has proceeded from it, from it

being exhausted; the grosser elements rather, out of which the cor· Α
poreal world has been formed, will all gradually be dissolved by it
and absorbed into it3 the world returns to the deity, to come lorth
again from it anew.³

willing, wise, or in other words as a personal being3 but in the uni·
verse that has proceeded from it there arise, as individual manifesta·

scious, thinking, willing, hence personal beings3 and these areos two
sorts: the less perfect, laden with coarserbodies, limited toashort lise,
burdened with manisold weaknesses and defects, but still capable of
perfection and of wisdom; these are mankind; and, secondly, the
