2 DE NATURA DEORUM.

This is sufficient to indicate in general the relation of the phi·
losophy of religion to the popular religion3 it would of necessity be

variously modified according to the greater or less degree in which
speculation had freed itself from the influence of the popular faith;
to hold a quite free and independent position was never an easy
matter. The saith in which a person was brought up, and which
. prevailed around him, necessarily exercised air influence upon phi-
losophy, and the latter, instead of taking its own course regardless
of the result it might reach, was often directed to a foregone con-
clusion from adesire to keep in harmony with the common saith.
Although there was in antiquity no catechetical instruction, yet the
universal belief operated with the same forcel and implanted preju-
dices and modes of thought in the mind, before it could test and
judge them, from which it afterwards found it difficolt to break loose.
Even where speculative reason was least affected by such influences
the factors of the problem differed according to the ability and culture
of individuals3 and hence the inevitable consequence, that instead
of sure and demonstrable results one reached only theories and
opinions; and the confusing variety of these fully justified the most
conscientious persons in concluding that it was useless to hope for
any positive knowledge in these matters, and that every one must
adopt such opinions as best satisfied his own reason and tempera-
ment3 and we find this confession to be the result which Cicero
reaches in the present essay.

The treatise consists of four parts: first, a brief sketch of the
’ most noteworthy opinions on the subject from the beginning of phi·
losophic speculation down to the complete development of the
Epicurean and the Stoic systems3 second, a detailed exposition of
the Epicurean, and third, of the Stoic philosophy, fourth,a criti-
cism of both these systems from the standpoint of the Academic
scepticism. ἵ

We have to lament that the first part affords us only incompleta,
often obscure, and always untrustworthy indications¹; enough per-
haps for the Epicurean to whom Cicero assigns them, but quite in-
sufficient to give us any real insight into the development of religious
philosophy and its various systems. Unfortunately we have no

many things appear in a quite different light.
