20 DE NATURA DEORUM.

omnem consolationem vinni dolor. Quin etiam feci, quod profecto
ante me uento, ut ipse me per litteras consolarer) Affirmo tibi nullam
consolationem csse talem. Totos· dies scribo, non quo proficiam ali-
quid ,- sed tantisper inpedior, nort equidem satri, -vr's enim urget, -

opportunity, as public affairs were at the time, for him to engage in
them with dignity and success, and so obtain relief from his sorrow3
and this condition of the state itself for a man like Cicero was no
less a source of sadness, than his own domestic grief.

When we consider these circumstances we are little disposed to
pass a strict judgment on Cicero's philosophical voris, but rather
to excuse many undoubted shortcomings in an old man afflicted and
¹borne down by sadness and care. Even a philosopher by profession
would hardly have been able in such a state of mind and in so short
a time to write satisfactorily upon all the most difficult problems of
philosophy at such length3 how much less a man, who, however
earnestly he had studied these subjects, was really only a dilettante3
and who for the larger and better part of his life had been occupied
as a statesman and an advocate with great activity and brilliant suc·
cess. His philosophicul writings are in fact little else than transla-
tions or extracts from Greek predecessors⁸3 and we should not
wonder at many misunderstandings or other traces of haste and care·
lessness, which have been occasionally noticed ‘in the notes of this
volume, and which have given a welcome opportunity to critics fond
of emendations to show their skill. A striking case of this haste is
the hesterno dic II, 29, 73, and nudius tertius ΙΙΙ, 7, 18, as if the
conversation had occupied three days, whereas the beginning of the
second as wellas that of the third book represent it as begun and
finished on one and the same day.⁸ These defects must not how·
ever preventus from a thankful recognition of Cicero¹s merits even
as a philosophical writer. He was the first to develop the Latin

⁸ Nudius tertius would be en error too with the division into three days, as ln

that cnse the discourse of Balbus, to which it refers, must bave been mede on
the day immediately preceding, and not two days before.
