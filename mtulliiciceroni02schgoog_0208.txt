BOOK lecim. XIV, §5 ³5·³7· 195

Or shall we assume that Cicero thought to put a somewhat inappropriate
expression in the mouth oi the Epicurean? ⁸

43. 23. astris. See 11, 15.

43. 24 annia, mensibus &c Evidently c perversior, to which Zeno’s
allegorical explanatione oi the mythological gods perhaps gave occasion.

, 43. 25. Hesiodi theogonium interpretatur. Zeno certainly wrote
no particular commentary on the Theogony, but only referred to it in his
writings on natural philosophy, such as περὶ κόσμου, and explained the
theogonic iables allegorically, per quandam significationem as is stated
below, in harmony with his system.

43. 26. usltatos perceptasque. See note to 11, 39, 924)οω-
tiones :notiones, as below c. 17, 44.

43. 30. Aristonis oi Chios, not be conlounded with the Peripatetic tt
oi the same name irom Ceos. We have no other information regarding
his doctrines, and hence conform no judgment ol the correctness oi the

, statement here made.

43. 33. Cleanthea oi Assos in Lycia, Zeno‘s successor as head oi the
Stoic school.

43. 34. ipsum mundum. Zeno had done the same before. See 11,
8, 21.

43. 35. totius naturae monti atque anlrno, r'.e. to the soul oi the
universe. This is a repetition oi the idea oi the preceding phrase; ior
the universe is only called God, because it is filled with and animated by
the universal soul. Comp. Varro in August. De Civit. Dei vll, 62 Hunc
ipsum mundum erse deum sed sicul hominem sapientem, cum sit ex cor·
pore et altimo, tamen ab animo dici sapientem, ita nitendum deuter de'ce' ab
animo, quum sit ex animo et corpore.

44. ι. ultimum . . . ardorem. Also the same thing in another iorm3
ior it is the fiery ether that partly encompasses the universe, partly pene·

trates it as its soul.
44. 7. ln nnlml notione...roponore. Epicurus assumed theex·

istence oi nn innate idea, the so·called πρόληψις, ⁰f G0d (5οε 0· 16,.43);
a god, to be entitled to our belief, must correspond to this lunate idea,
must fit into this mould, so to spealr3 and this is itseli the prool whether
he is really a god: just as, if we wished to ascertain whether ἃ ἷῡθῑ were
tlre one it pnrported to be. we were to place it in one oi its mot-prinis· and
judge irorn the result. η Comp. Plato Republ, p. 462 A: ἄρα ἃ νῦν ritmo·
W εἷς Τὸ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἴχνος ἡμῖν ἀρμόττεις so also Cicero Orat. c. 38, ¹33²
ea oratio (Demosthenis de Corona) in eam sirmam, quae est inrita in
mentibus nostris, includi sic potest, ut ntaior eloquentia non requiratur:
where the idea is also the irame into which the work ol art must fir. So
ibid. c. 5, ¹5·
