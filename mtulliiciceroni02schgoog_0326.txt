’ bins Ι, 31 says of God: tu esde quo nihil dici et exprimi mortalium potis
'est significatione veriorum: quid ut intelligurt's, tacendum est, atquc ul
per umbram le possit errem inuestigare suspitio, ntttl est omnino muti·
endum. And 111, 19: Quicquid de deo dixeris, quicquid tacitae mentis
cogitatione conceperis, inhumanum transilit et corrumpitur sensum, nec
iaici propriae significationis nolam, quod nostris dicitur verbis alque ad

Ἀλαβανδεῑς. Comp. Schneider Formenlehre, p. 308, and Lachmann¹s
Lucretius, p. 281 note. Below e. 1'9, 50 Cicero uses the Latin form Ala·

next proposition (ie. that the universe is God), for it is all very excel·
lent,’¹-although not true-as we most suppose the Academic thought;
