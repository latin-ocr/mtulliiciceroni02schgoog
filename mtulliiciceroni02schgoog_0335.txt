154. 7. Νόμιον. Apollo share· this surname with Hermes Arist.
‘l'nesm V. 977.¹ It really means however not the iawgiver, as Cicero and
others explain it, but the god of the pastures and flocks ; and ’Aeolum
νόμως is properly, so far as the idea is concerned, the same with Aristaeus,
mentioned in c. 18, 45 as the son of Apollo. Cf. Pind Pyth. IX, 65 (115).
The form Nomionem of the Mss. is only an error of the copyists. · ι

18 15410. Upls as the name of a male deity only occurs here. Itis
often found as a surname of Diana, where it is regarded as a collateral
form of ὁπις, dats, and explained as referring to the oversight of the actions
of men and to the punishment of their transgressions.

154. 12. Dionysos multos. Itis extraordinary that just here the
Dionysus of the common mythology, son of Zeus and Semelam passed
over. Those that are mentioned all belong either to the Orphic or other
fables unknown to us. -On the Triatsrldes see Schoem. Griech. Alterth.

154. 23. orta Nilo. The Aegyptias Neithis meant, commonly iden·
tifred with Minerva; although others call her not the daughter of Nilus,
but of Zeus (Diod. I, 15) or of Hermes (Plut. De Is. et Osir, c. 7). Ac·
cording however to Jablonslri, Panth. A. Ι, p. 168, Nifm' rs just the same
as Zeus.

154. 25. Coryphe probably owes her origin to later mythologists, who
explained the story of the birth of Minerva from the head (ἐκ κορυφῆς) of
Zeus by substituting a nymph, Coryphe, for the head. Cf. Schoem. Opusc.

uu 154 32· quibus intellegls resistendum esse. When Cotta rn this
passage, as also' 1n c 21, 5 3 speaks against Euhemerism, he does so solely
in the interest of religion, of which' 1n several passages Ι, 22, 61 and 623
ΙΙΙ, 2, 5. 6 he has avowed himself a devoted adherent. He wishes there(
fore that the popular deities should be considered not only as men who
have been wrongly deified‚ but as really gods. As an Academic he could
attach no importance to this ; he must on the contrary have considered the .
fahles about the gods as reprehensible in so far as they were believed to
be real histories of the gods 3 and Euhemerism‚ which took ground against
this belief and considered them merely as accounts of the actions of rnen,
must have rather seemed to him commendante-Cotta might however
blame the Stoics from both points of view, because instead of setting theru
