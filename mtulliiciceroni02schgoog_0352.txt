universe, and Karsten, Xenoph, p. 136 has observed that the mente ad·
iuncta of Velleius is to be understood, not of an original immanence, but·
of a connection of the mens (the intelligence) with the omne that has come
from without, and he considam itan error of Velleius-The praeterea
immediately following in the traditional punctuation, of which the corn·
mentators say nothing, has been, to say the least, misunderstood in the
strangest manner by the translators. Itis unnecessary to give again here
the examples cited in the Jahrbuch. They all have this in common, that
they construe praeterea with the preceding words mente adiuncta omne,
which affords no adequate sense. Velleius must have only stated what
Xenophanes had said in regard to the connection of the omne with meris
besides the fact itself. This is of two sorts, namely, that it is limitless,
and that it is God; or in other words that the predicate of infinity as
wellas that of deity may be made of it. It might occur to some one per·
haps to take the words quod esset infinitum as an inserted relative clauser
but such a clause would not follow, but rather precede, praeterea. The
difficulty is best met by taking quael, not for a relative pronoun, but as a
conjunction = “ that.'' lt is conceded that it has this function in the phrase
propterea quod,· and there appears to be no rational ground why it may
not have the same force with praeterea. There are, it is true, no exempla
probantia of the usage; but in Biinemann's note to Lactantius 1. D. ΙΙΙ,
8, r 5 several examples are cited of praeter quod for praeterquam quod,
two also of praetereo quod, which one might be inclined to regard as an
error for praeterea quod.

I,13,34. et modo mundum tum mentem divinam esse putat. tum
mundum would of course have been more elegant, as Baiter and others

before him have written. But as ettamen modo meandum is found in the
best Mss, it seemed unadvisable to reject the modo. The tamen may be
considered a copyist's error for tum, and the tum an emendation, which
had crept into the text, from the margin, of some corrector who wished to
. remedy the inelegance. In regard to this, not at all an unusual one, con· ⁸

I, r 5, 39, fatalem vim, the reading of a single Mss, is doubtless only
aconjeeture, which 1 have adopted, not because Ι thought it the correct
reading, but because it at least gives a better sense than sitalem umbram
of the other Mss. Fur other emendations see Baiter's note and my Opusc.
