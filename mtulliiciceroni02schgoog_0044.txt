lt was quite consistent to asslgn thern a separate abode in the inter·
mandris (see note on c. 8. 18). Epicurus probably did not express
himself further on their manner of liie in the intermundia‚ but sim-
ply ascribed to them the undisturbed enjoyment ol the highest hap-
piness, without entering into details; for he was shrewd enough to
see that it was impossible to know anything about ir. and that
everybody must be allowed to lancy it as it seemed to him most
probable. with the limitation ol course that the conception did not
conflict with their happiness aud immortality.

His opponents especially ridiculed his theory ot' the quasi corpo
’ realt'ty ol the gods, which was really undeserving oi it (see note on
c. 18, 49). The bodily likeness ot' the gods to men, which Epicurus
assumed for the reasons indicated by Velleius, was considered by
them as ridiculous on the ground that the gods, in the utter quiet
and inactivity ol their lives, would have no use lor the organs and
members ol the human body; as il Epicurus had really meant by
quiet and inactivity an absolutely immovable torpidity (67-102), and
’ not rather a simple ireedom from everything like labor and trouble.
which was quite compatible with a life spent in pleasures and enjoy-
ments'‚ only oi other aud more refined sorts than the earthly and
human pleasures; compatible too with virtues. though oi course not
quite the same as those springing from earthly and human relations.
but ratherthose corresponding to the conditions of the divine ex-
istence. Again wheu his opponents ridiculed Epicurus on the one
hand sor setting up male and female deities‚ including naturally
the seuual relations between them¹3 and on the other ior making
them all' alilre, and hence unable ⁴to distinguish oue another
(to-84), it is evident that one objection contradicts the other, and
one of the two must be salse. The truth probably is this: Epicurus
taught that by means os the impressions or pictures which come
from the gods to the soul oi man we acquire only a general concep·
tion oi gods similar to men. not one oi individual distinguishable
divine personalities3 this does not however exclude the possibility
oi their actual existence3 and when he spoke of sexual and other

¹0bjections similar to those brought by Cotta against the bodily nature ol
the gods ol Epicurus have long ago suggested themselves to Christian theolo-
gians against the bodily nature oi men aiter the resurrection irom the dead.
