Ac. 111, p. 363. -That ignem in the suceeeding clause is not to be under·
stood of the common earthly as opposed to the etherial sire, as the most
recent translator has it, would be evident, not only from the note to the
passage and whatis said in the sunrmnry of the second book, p. 73, but
from the position alone of iguem in the phrase, which would be hard to
explain if the common fire were really intended.

1, 19, 49. A. Brieger (Beitr. zur Kritik einig. phil. Schr. des Cicero,¹
Posen, 1873) has rightly remarked that in the words earu esse vim et na·
turam dearum, utnon sensu sed merite cernatur the phrase mente cereri,
opposed to sensu cerui, can mean nothing but the ψυχικὴ moturae, ie.

the simple perception by the faculty which Lucretius calls the meus
animi, andin which the feeling, perceiving and thinking capacity of the
soul dwells. ibe same statement is therefore made here as in Lucret. V,
149, tenuis euim oratura deum longeque remota sensibus a nostris animi
aix meute videtur. But we must not neglect the difference of ais et ua·
tura deorum and tenuis natura deum. The latter, on account of the
epithet tenuis, can only he understood of the divine quasi corpus which
the mind perceives, because in virtue of its possessing the same tenuitas it
is in immediate contact with and directly affected by it; the vis et natura
deorum is something more than this quasi corporeality, and denotes the
whole onter and inner constitution upon which the vitae actio and the
mentis agitatio (ξ 45 ff), virtue, wisdom‚ happiness and immortality of
the gods depend. If in the passage under discussion we are to under·
stand simply the corporeality of the gods, of which we are cognizant by
mere perception, Cicero could not have written cernatur, which would
only admit vis et natura for its subject, but cernantur, sc. di, which 1
(Prof. Sch.) have therefore restored. The perceptible tenuitas of the gods,
although not the same as their ais et notura, still isa part of it, is one side
of their being, and may therefore as depending upon this be designated by
ut ‚· it lies in the nature of the gods that their corporeality as well should
¹be perceivable only hy the meus, and not by the senses. ln the Greek
original which Cicero used there was probably an infinitive depending on
bare, perhaps γιγνώσκεσθαι, which could be rendered in Latin by the singu· ὁ
laras well as by the plural of the finite verb. Thus Cotta in his reply
(ξ 105) takes the proposition as applicahle only to the corporeality and
not to the collective being of the gods, and speaks of the speciem dei be·
cause this alone in the gods is what we immediately perceive, quod mente
cernitur. When Cicero makes him say percipi cogitatione instead of the
mente cerui of Velleius. we may regard it as the result of the same haste
apparent in other passages in this treatise, which caused him to overlook

the difference between the two expressions.
