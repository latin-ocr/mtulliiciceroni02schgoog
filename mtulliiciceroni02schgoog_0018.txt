'4 that Pythagoras paid a pious reverence to the popular gods¹3 and
none oi the older philosophers seems to have been accused of the
contrary. lt is true that Socrates was reproached by his accusers
with denying the gods oi the people and introducing new ones3 but
this reproach was in fact rather a deductiori drawn by themselves
irom certain utterances of Socrates than one which he had deserved

- by his actual opinions. We know on the contrary hythe most

credible evidence* that he by no means withdrew irom the tradi·
tional worship oi the gods, and hence did not deny their existence;
although he imagined them as different‘from the common concep-
tion, and thought it most advisable not to touch upon the mytho-
logical iables unless occasion required.³ Nor did the pupils os Soc·
rates find it necessary to deny the existence oi the popular denies,
although Plato held that there was a higher god above them whose
creatores and servants they were3 and we do not find that he was
attached for despising the popular religion. His opinion oi the my·
thological iablesmay be sufficiently gathered from the iact thatlhe
banishes from his ideal state the poets who originated and circulated
them3 although he is not at all opposed in itself toamythological form
of discourse upon divine things; indeed he often makes use of it to
express figuratively what he cannot express literally. Antisthenes
'too assumed, like Plato, only one supreme deity, but did not hesi·
tate to make the multitude oi popular deities subordinate to him.
He regarded the mythological fables, at least in part, as allegories3
' and expressed in the severest manner his disapproval oi the concep-
tione of the gods which corresponded to the literal sense oi the
fables.⁴ Aristotle took the same course': and what we read of his
disciples‚ as for example Heraclides of Pontus or Theophrastus (Cic.
Nat. Deor. Ι, ι 3, 34. 35), shows only views which, though foreign to
the popular religion, are still not irreconcilable with it. No more
did Strato come into collision with the popular saith in accephng,
