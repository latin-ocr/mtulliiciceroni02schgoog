SUMMARY. -135

even the most monstrous and most ridiculous gods (43-50). 1f
the heavenlybodies are gods, there is no reason for not considering
the rainbows‚ clouds and winds as gods; if earth and sea pass for
gods, so must rivers and springs3 in short there is no limit (51, 52).
The learned inquirers think they have found out that all the chief
gods of the popular belief were only men of olden time who have
not actually become gods but are only imagined to be so by the
deluded people. Such a view, Cotta thinks, must necessarily be
rejected in the interest of religion itself¹3 but the Stoics‚ by
their allegorical explanation of these pretended gods and the stories
about them, have, instead of rejecting them, rather given them a
sort of respectability (53-60). Still all their views are easily re-
futed. Some of the beings explained to be gods are evidently
impersonal things, qualities and relations3 and all the rest after the
Stoic explanations, instead oi gods, become mere forces of nature.

Next carne in the original the third part or the refutation of the
proposition that the world is governed by the divine provideuce3
but the whole of this part is lost.¹ A large portion of the
fourth part is also no longer extant, which was devoted to show-
ing that the gods had no especial care for men. The remaining
portion (ξ 66) relates to Balbus's eulogy of reason as the
rnost excellent gift of the gods to men (Bk. 11, c. 61). Cotta

¹ For' this reiection of Euhemerlsm see note on 23, 60. Cotta ⁸ls here evl·
dently guilty of an incpnsistency. For if in the interest of religion, in order not
to talre from the common people the gods in whom they believed, he reiected
the Euhemeristic humanizing of,them, the same interest would necessarily

have deterred him also from interfering with any one of the deities worshipped
by the people which he has really done ln many instanees ln what has pre·
ceded. ’ lt would seem that this inconsistency is due to Cicero alone, and that
the real Academic philosophers by uo means disdained to make use of Euhe-
, merism as a weapon against the popular religion: iustas at a subsequent
period the Christian opponents of polytheism were fond of doing. And that
Cicero himself did not-refusa to acknowledge a justification for Euhemerism is
seen from Tusc. l, 13· 28, and V, 3, 8.

² We say nothing on the questioh whether this part was¹ designedly de·
stroyed, because it might endanger laith and piety. Amobius (ΙΙΙ, 7) testifies
that in reality many even among the heatben were scandalized at this book of
Cicero's, and thought lt ought to be destroyed: and according to lactantius
(D. l. 11, 3, a) Cotta said in· the third boolr': non esse illa vulgro disputanda, ne
susceptus publice religiones deputatio talis exstingueret. .. . .
