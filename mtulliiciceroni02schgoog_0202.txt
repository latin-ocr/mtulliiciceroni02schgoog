41. 8. Xenophanes, born at Colophon, was banished irum there, and
emigrated to the Phocaean colony ol Elea in lower ltaly; he was contern-
porary with the Persian wars and founder os the Eleatic school.

41. 8. mente adiuncta omne praeterea, quod mot lnflnltrrm &c
Construed thus the sense must almost necessarily be, that Xenophanes
understood the mens and besides (praeterea) the infinite All as two dil·
ferent things, but stillas subsisting in union, and that he called them both
together God. lt Velleius really meant this, it was certainly an error and
in contradiction with what we know ol Xenophanes from other sources.
Ihave therefore talren the liberty to change the traditional punctuation,
writing omne, praeterea quod instead os unane praeterea, quod dre. Itis
certain that praeterea quod might have been said as equivalent to praeter·
quam quod, though there rnay be no other example of it. The sense ol
the passage would then ber that Xenophanes taught that the Omne,
endowed with intelligence, was not only infinite, but was also God. [We
have retained the usual punctuation in the text]

41. ro. item, ut ceteri, like Thales sor example (c. ιο, 25) and
Anaxagoras (c. 11, 26).

41.11. neque sentiens nequa coniunctum. Whatever is infinite
cannot be touched by anything outside os itself, and hence cannot expe·
rience sensation (see note to ς 26) nor stand in connection with any·
thing, because outside ol itsels there is nothing.

41.12. Parmenides ol Elea, disciple ol Xenophanes, set forth doc· ⁸
trinea such as are here cited in the‘s‘econd partos his didactic poem, in
which he treated, not as in the hrst part περὶ τοῦ ὄντος, ie. oi that which
really exists, bur περὶ τῶν αὶσθιιτῶν, oi phenomena; and set up a sort ol
scientific dogmatism (τὰ πρὸς δόξαι).

41. ¹3· coronae simila. In the world sprung from the elementary
substance Parmenides assumed the existence os a number of concentric
spheres, which he called orepdvac: τὴν dd peucrrdrnu ἀπάσαις τοκέα rol
κλῃδοῦχον ἐπονομάζει, δίκην re rol ἀνάγκην, Stobae. Ecl. 1, p. 482. Comp.
the verse ol Parmenides preserved by Simplicius, Phys. i. 9 aa iv tl μέσῳ
τούτων δαίμων, ἣ πάντα κυβερνᾷ. ln taking the exterior sphere os all lor
the abode ol the δαίμων instead os the middle one Velleius contounds the
views ol Parmenides with those os the Stoics. On this see c. 14, 373 aud
comp. Somn. Scip. c. 4

41. ¹3· continente ardore, ie. continuo, perpetuo. Comp. Curt. VII,
20, 2: continenti incendio cuncta torrentur.-1uets orbam=0rbem
lucidum.

41. 16. monstra, also used ol lautastic views, absurdities in 111, ty,
443 like portenta, 1, 8, 183 16, 435 and 111, 38, 91.
