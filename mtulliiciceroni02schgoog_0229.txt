58. 21. arguments antennas conclusisti [Miller 11161 arga·
menta sententiam, “you bave drawn up the arguments for your opinion in
regular, syllogistic forms.” Comp. De Fin. 111, 8, 27 ε concluduntur egitur
earum argumenta sic ,· Aead. 11, 9, 27: quae esset conclusi argumenti
fides. F or the conclusion of Velleius see above c. 18, ait-Tne reading
of this passage is uncertain. 'i'he Mas. have argumenti sententiam, which
ispossibly an error for argumenti summam. summam arationis is used

in the sarire signification in De Or. 11, 38, 158 and summa is coufounded
with sententiae by the copyists in other passages. See Madvig De Fin. ΙΙ,
31, 106.

Virg. AEn. IV, 678.-Qu1nauram est 8111. [Schoemann reads qui on the
ground that the question really is, not what the gradatim means, but with
what propriety it can be applied to the form of argument of Velleius]

su 58. 35. tonnae figuram, “the structure of the form ’‘ (die Bildung
der Gestalt), as Lucretius says, IV, 671 veterem firmae servare figuram.
Forma denotes the form as shown in the general impression which it
makes, figura the structure and relation of the parts; the forma stands out
visibly; the inner construction enters into the figura. Hence Cicero says
in De offic. Ι, 35, 1261 sormam nostram ceteramque figuram: and the
colour may also enter into thesemo, ibid. 36,130: firmae dignitas colaris
bonitate tuenda-On the following (ΙΙ semper filerunt see the Sum·
mali· l)- 27·

59. 3. ea, qua erant forma dl. 'l'he farma of the preceding clause
is repeated, as often happens, in the relative clause for the sake of greater
precision; and the use of the demonstrative ea in the foregoing need not
prevent such repetition, as has been supposed. Comp. Caes. Bell. Gall. Ι,
49, 1, ultra earn locum, qua in iaco Germani consederant: Cic. in Catil.
ΙΙΙ, 1ο, 25: in hac autem uno bella, quale bellum· Pro Cluent. c. 54 init:
lex ea, qua lege: and ibid. 57‚166; De Repub. 1, 26: adeam causam
referendum est, quae causa genuit civitatem.

such questions see note to 5 84.

88 59.15. memoriter, notasoften explained “from memory,’' but “with
good mernory, correct memory” [“nrindfully” from memar.], forgetting
nothing, see Madvig De lin, p. 74
