ἱ gods external good things only, is not made by the Stoic, but by

the Academic as against the Stoic (111, 36. 87). He is wrong in

ν · representing this view as generally prevailing (as is shown in the

note to that passage) ς but those who consider it as the only opinion
held by the Stoics are no more in the right; ior in the Stoic system
there was nothing which clashed at all with the directly opposite
'vrew
While the Stoic theology attempted in the manner just described
partly to correct and complete, partly to explain and so support the
popular religion, it encountered, in common with the irreligion ol
Epicurus, which in reality was little better than atheism, the opposi-
tion ol the critical scepticism ol the New Academy, which held any
certain knowledge on any subject to be impossible, conceding only
a greater or less degree of probability3 and hence carried on a con-
tinual strife with the dogmatism oi the other schools. Arcesilas, the
founder oi this later Academy, not only repeated the famouspropo·
sition os Soc'rates, that he knew only one thing, and that was, that
he knew nothing3 but he went beyond him, saying that even this,
that he knew nothing, he did not know, but only surmised ἰῐ.Ι He
and his followers considered nothing as absolutely certain but reason
and the right os using it, even this however they held could not
help us to a sure knowledge oi things. All thought, so they argued,
can only proceed upon certain data3 the only data we have are those
oi experience, which come from impressions on the senses3 but
these impressione are unreliable, they are undoubtedly often false,
aud there is no periectly sure criterion whereby to distinguish the true
from the false. Hence complete certainty ol knowledge is impos·
sible; we can only attainffto mere opinions. These may be true,
they may be salse as well; and alter all testing and comparing we
can do no more than distinguish various grades oi probability;
and, since actual knowledge is beyond our reach, we must content
ourselves with reasonable opinion and belles. Hence, whenever a
definite opinion was advanced on any subject, they were accus·
temed to take the opposite side, in order to show that there was
nothing which did not admit oi discussion. and that it became the
wise nran to withhold any definite and confident judgment3 assen-
sionem cohibcre, B. l, c. 1.-Cicero himself held this doctrine, as
