APPENDIX. 335

cannot be granted at all. ‘lhe indefinite sense, “in all places whatever,'’
isalways admissible3 and there are passages where this is the only one
possible, as eg. Cic. Verrin. V, 67, 172: Omnes hoc Ioco cives Romani, et
qui adsuntet qui ubique sunt, vestram severitatem desiderant. lt seems
therefore an error to conclude from those other passages that the indefinite
meaning ol' ubique was an innovation adopted perhaps in the time of
Horace; and this seems to me all the more improbable, since utrobique or
utrubique, which also contains ubi, occurs in Cicero and his contempora·
ries as an indefinite quite in the same way and without a preceding pro·
noun, and since in general it is a mistake to conclude irorn the non·
occurrence oi an expression in the extant remains oi these authors that ’
they never made use oi it. 1 might have proposed ubivis, instead ot
ubique.

11, 23, 61. The praenomen (A) before Atilio, which is wanting in the
Mss, is added at the well-founded suggestion of Fleckeisen. See his
Kritisclre Miscellen in the Progr. des Vitathumschen Gymnasiums, Dresden,

Il,5o,126. Baiter reads, according to Madvig's proposal: purgantes
aretem alvos ibes Aegyptiae curantur. But inasmuch as, so far as I know,
all the Mss. have the active curant, and purgatione is found at least in
some although perhaps by way of conjecture only for purgante of others,
and purgantes is found in none,1 have not ielt authorized to make the
change. · “

II, 54, 136. et terendo cibo et praeterea spiritu. After the preceding
omne quod accepit certainly cibo is an unnecessary and perhaps erroneous
addition. ·Stilll have not omitted it ior the reason that, it one should

strike out all such little irregularities which the best writer may be guilty
ol, he would easily run the risk oi correcting the author instead oi the
copyist.

11, 55, 136. Madvig’s conjecture, intrante spiritu, is certainly so iar as
regards diplomatic criticism entirely unobjectionable, and bears witness of
the masterly skill in this department which has made him an authority,
and explains how many have unquestioningly assented to him, as Baiter
does in this passage. But since Cicero has reminded us above I, 5, ro, non
. tam auctores e'n disputando quam rationis momenta quaerenda sunt, we
may be allowed here to look a little more closely ior the reason oi the
thing. ll' Cicero had written intrante spiritu, we should have to assume
