attempts to show on the contrary that reason, since it is so often
turned to evil purposes and brings so mnch harm, cannot by any
possibility be regarded as a divine gift3 lor we cannot suppose either
that the gods would have given to men a hurtsul gift or that they
could not have prevented or foreseen the evil use which mankind
would make of it (66-78). Gods who really wished well to man-
kind ought rather to have made them good and wise3 or il not
this, they ought at least to have had a care sor those who are¹ good
and wisc (79, 80). But this is no more the case than the other;
the best men often lare the worst, and the worst the best; expe·
rience gives no prool whatever os a divine justice, which rewards
virtue and punishes vice; and this would afford encouragement to
crime, were it not lor conscience, which, regardless of the deity,
furnishes to mankind a support and guide (81-85). But no evi-
dence os divine government is discernible here3 and the pretext that
the gods concern themselves with human affairs only in general, not
with trifles, is inadmissible, because the cases in which the absence
of divine justice is selt, are by no means all trifles of no impor-
tance (86). The general belief regards precisely the external
gilts of fortune, not the interna! ones such as virtue and wisdom, as
coming from the gods3 and thus the good fortune, which bad men
enjoy, is a proot against the divine government ol the world (87,
88). lsolated instances, in which the good meet with success, are
ol no weight against the majority ol cases where the contrary hap·
pens3 and itis no excuse to say either that the gods do not concern
themselves with every individua! case or that they are ignorant
(89, 90). And to say that the gods visit the punishment ol evil
deeds, if not on the evil-doers themselves, at least upon their children
and descendants is to attribute to them the greatest injustice. But
suffering and missortune come not from any god, but lrom men
themselves. The deity does not protect us against it, even where
it should justly do so, il, as the Stoics say, it has the power to do
what it wills. So then the deity is ignorant of what it can do, orit
has no concern sor mankind, or it is incapable os judging what is
good (91, 92). The Stoics contradict themselves, says Cotta, when
they say that the gods do not concern themselves with details, and
at the same time maintain that dreams come lrom the gods, and urge
everybody to pray to the deity, sor in that case the deity must hear
the prayers of individuale. -
