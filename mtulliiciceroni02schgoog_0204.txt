41. 34. Platonis lnoomtantta. This inconsistency evidently can-tu
nothe held to exist between the two assertions contained in the following
relative clause, which are not at all contradictory3 but in the positive
views afterwards cited which Plato sets forth in other places. Conse·
quently Cicero should hare made the clauses, in which these views are
stated, also dependent on'the relative qui, opposing thern to what precedes
by tamen: for example, qui in Τ imaeo (or qui, cum in Timaeo) . ..
censeat, alibi tamen sine torp. &c.‘ [The opposition seems to he rather
between qui in Timaeo. . . censeat and the sentence beginning Ideni'et
r’n Timaeo. Cicero says that in these two dialognes Plato holds that
nothing can be known of the Deity', aad yet ia the very ιιιιιι dialogues he
says that various things, mandunt, caetum, astra dc. are' God. Compare
what is said of Xenophon inune next passage: finci! Socratem disputari-
te'm firmam dei quaeri non oportere, candentque et solem et animum hum
dicere &c.' The clause Quod uero&c. merely mentions¹ ιιι passing another
notion of Plato on the ιιιιιι subject]

either from designor carelessness has ignored Plato’s true meaning.

42. 3. ἆσήιιτον. Plato does not himself use this expression in the'l'i·
maeus, although he does so in other dialogues. 1 should hesitate to take
this as an interpolation as Baiter and Heindorf do. The corresponding
Latin word incorporeus is' not found as early as Cicero. Comp. Gell. V,
151.

Plato allowed the gods of the popular belief, as he had no reason to deny
their existence, to' pass for creatures and servants of the supreme God.
