μακάριον inuisas τὸν fietu elnac τοῦτο utputa imagine to thyself an immor-
tal aud happy being, and think that God is such a one. The ideas of im·
mortality and happiness might os must have arisen in the mind as the
natural opposites of misery aud mortality, whether impressions carm to it
from the gods or not; but there is none among all the objecta, from which
impressione come, to which these ideas correspond, all of these are proved
to be mortal and not happy with the single exceptionof the gods, per·
ceived by means of their impressions always uniformly appearing. If then
there are any immortal aud happy beings, and there is no sufficient ground
to deny it, the gods must be such De hoc argumentandi genere utcumque
iudicabitur, hoc tamen sistendum erit, non infirmius esse, quam quo alios

1, 24, 66. Democritus derived the origin and further development of
all things by necessity from the motion, the whirl (diury) of atoms, as Cicero
himself s'ays, De Fato, c. ro, 23: Democritus, auctor atomorum, accepere
maluit necessitate omnia fieri, quam a corporibus individuis naturales
rnotus avellere: aud Diog. L. IX, 452 adura κατ’ ἀνάγκην γίνεσθαι, τῆς
δίνης αἰτίας mons τῆς γενέσεως πάντων, ἢν ἂνάγκην λέγει. But since this
necessity existed nowhere else than iu the atoms themselves, and the δίνη
was uot caused by anything external to them Cicero was right in saying
nulfo cogente notura and calling the coucourse of the atoms fortuitous, just

as Aristotle referring to the doctrine of Democritus aad Leucippus says,
Physic.11,4: int ταύτομάτου γίγνεσθαι τὴν δίνην rai τὴν κίνησιν τὴν dea-
spivaoav rai raraorhaaaav εὶς rahryv τὴν τάξιν sd πᾶν. For Democritus did
uot accept any sort of nature external to and working upon the atoms, or

any regulation of their motione toward a given ead. Comp. Bouitz ou
Aristot. Metaph, p. 76. There was no reason therefore to accuse Cicero
of au errorin the matter, as the most recent translator has done.

1, 25, 71. The proper sense of the phrase concretio individuorum corpo·
rum is given iu the note. The misunderstanding of this has misled not only
Lactantius, De Ira Dei, c. 10, 27, but some earlier writers on the history of
philosophy, to the opinion that Epicurus either held the gods to be entirely
incorporeal, or at least attributed to them bodies consisting not of atoms
but of some indeterminable substance. More upon this subject may be
found in Schoemanu’s schediasma De Epicuri Theologia, Opusc. Ac.
IV, 342.

1, 28, 79. The naevus in articulo pueri might seem too small a mat·
ter to be at all regarded hy the lover. It has therefore been proposed to
read naeuus in Lyco puero ,· one Ms. has in Rericte puero.
