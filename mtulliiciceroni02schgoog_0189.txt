visum t'or the Greek φαντασία, as in Acad. 1, tt, 40 and 11, 6, 18, and this

is one reason why Heindorf brackets this whole sentence3 Baiter does
the semel-The construction at the end ol the sentence is not quite
regular. lt would be more correct were it either quae . . . rapientis agilam
regerent or quibus . . . sapientis vilo regeretur. As it is, quae quam-
quam can only be equivalent to et quamquam haec, and one would rather ,
expect iis sapientis vitam regi, so that both clauses, nerelta esse probabilia
and iis. . . regi connected by quae (lor er haec), would depend on exstitit.
But such irregularity is easily explained and excused.

36.11. perciperentur. This expression, like conprehendere with
which it is osten coupled, especially in the Lucullus, denotes a perlectly
certain and undoubted knowledge and comprehension ol an object, the

who reirained lrom any such Judgment: nullam rem aperte iudicant,

care. [But why are the Dogmatics summoned rather than any others?
and in point ot lact the Academic bears a most important part in the
dialogue. The natural meaning ol' qui . . . iudicent would seem to be “to
consider the sententias philosophorum in medio positos and judge which ol
them are trne ''; iudicare quae si! earum vera can hardly mean ‘⁶ to hold
a clear opinion on the question in general ”; earum must reler to senten·
tias preceding. 'l'he sentence seems to be rather an awkward appeal to
all the world, in the same vein as the quotation irom Caecilius Just below]
36.18. (cst) ln Synephebis. The verb is wanting in the lllss. Syn-
ephebi was the title ol a stabula palliata ol Caecilius Statius, a younger
contemporary ol Plautus. The Greelr' original was by Menander.-The
first two ol the verses citcrl are regular trochaic tetrameters3 the other two
were doubtless of the same mette, but, whether by the fault ol Cicero or
that ol the copyists, have gotten into confusion. [non vult3 nevolt

ll 36. 29. ausptotts, qulbus nos praesumus. Cicero ,had been a
member oi the college ol Augurs since the year 700 ol the city, the 54th
ol his age. He also wrote a book De Auguriis, probably alter the De Nat.
Deor. and De Divin. See the fragments in Orelli lV, 2, p. 478.
