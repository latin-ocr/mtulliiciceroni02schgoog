111, ty, 43. There is certainly something wanting aiter si di sunt.
· Something should follow which could be regarded as an apparent reason
ior the divinity oi such beings as the Nympha, aud then be reiuted ‘by
Cotta as not ualid proni ; perhaps si di sunt quitus sacrafiunt or the like.
On ne nymphae quidem egitur see Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 380.

111, 19, 50. It seems to me nearly certain that horandum should be
read tor hemnacum ot the Mss. In regard to the name leocorium, Ο. ·
hliiller, Iud. Schol. Gotting. 1840, supposes that it denoted properly a place
appointed tor the expiation of the sins of the people (leurdpof, atter the
analogy oi νεωκόρος), Inbeck, Pathol. l, p. 550, says: Suspectus est leos
heros et omnis illa de filiabus eius tabula, sicut omnia quae de Graecorum ,
sacrificiis humanis tradita sunt. Nomen Leocorion vel Leocori cuiusdam
monumentum est vel populi curiam s. λήιτον significat.

III, 29, 72. Instead of the Mss. parumne semper in ratione versantur ⁴

Baiter reads parumne saepe according to the conjecture ot Madvig and
older critics, which does not seem to me necessary. It is clear enough that
parum semper cannot be united 3 but parum should be taken with the
following in ratione versantur, whichis required by parumne subtiliter
disputat coming directly alter. It need not surprise one tbat it is separated
from it by semper ‚· there isa good reason tor the position. Semper points
to the fact that the levitates comicae are not always committed, though they
may otten be so, without ratio, without a sort ol reasoning to justify them.

111, 31, 77. Et si verum est dte. Baiter, alter Madvig, reads Ut si
verum esset. . ., brackets the words si, qui audierunt to interpretarentur
as a spurious interpolation, and makes the apodosis to the protasis com·
mencing with ut begin in ξ 78 with sic, si homines. . . There is no doubt
that Cicero might have written thus, and that it might have been better

had he done so 3 hut it does not seem to me necessary sor that reason to “

change the traditional reading ol the Mss. What is best is not always
genuine, aud slight inaccuracies are easier to excuse in a uentae which
evidently atlects the ireedom ot an extemporary conversation. We may
therefore excuse the repetition ol the protasis in si, qui audierunt dre, '
and tbe separation oi prorsus oi the apodosis from its verb tacere. Mad·
vig thought it necessary to change the si verum est to si uerum esset be-
cause, according to his conjecture, only these words could torm the protasis
to tacere praestaret ,· with the common reading this is unnecessary because
the protasis is contained in the clause si . . . essent discessuri. It is incredible ἡ
that this clause merely repeats in hypothetical [orm the thought expressed
at the beginning in more positive iorm by si verum est &ca-1 have
