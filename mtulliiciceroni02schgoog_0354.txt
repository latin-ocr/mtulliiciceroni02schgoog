· In tho last part ol the passage the words mentem intentam infixamque
nostram intellegentiam capere are evidently to be understood not oi the
simple contemplation or perception by the mens, but rather oi the process
ol reasoning which follows,·examines and searches ior the true ¹purp'ort ol
our perceptions. Perception alone is only receptive and' can naturally give
only the species deorum, as Cotta (5 107) rightly remarks ι bat 2 percep· .
tion that is only receptive and passive is not enough sor the human mind 3
itis therebyroused to an individua! activity. This is again ol two kinds a
first, soto speak, 2 cursory one, and the ideas which come irom it spon·
taneously are very properly called apollinar, notiones anticipatae‚ ante·
ceptae informationes (5 43). Ii they are sometimes called intellegentiae,
this is hardly done without an epithet to denote their nature, such as in·
cloatae, adumbratae, obscurae, Cic. De Leg. 1, 9, 25 ; ιο, 303 22, 59 (comp.
on De Offic. 111, 10,76); in reality they are only opiniones (5 45); they
cannot become intellegentia but through more exact investigation and
rational foundation which the mind aims at while it is busy with them.
This is denoted by the Greek irepdllaev, impoli (Schneider ad Epicur.
Physic, p. 65), and Cicero expresses it by animasse iniciens et intendens,
or, as in our passage, niens intento infixaque.

Now it the intellegentia thus gained is spoken ol as one quaeritet
lenta notura et aeterno it is plainly nonsense; and this is generally ec·
knowledged. The emendation I (Ptol. Sch.) proposed in my Opusc.
Acad. 1v, 347 1 called paullo obscurior ,⁰ but it is not so obscure that it,
might not be understood with a little thought. Bake‘s qnam sit ea leuto

are concerned3 but one ol the delenders oi this reading has not over·
’ looked the lact that quom cannot possibly be taken oi the measure or
degree ol happiness and immortality ol the gods. He has recourse there·
lore to the assumption that the difficulty oi the passage results lrom a rather ,
stupid misunderstanding on the part ol Cicero. He thinks Cicero lound
in the Greek original that he was translating ὣς, which there had the
force oi ὅτι corresponding to ‘⁴ tbat” introducing a sentence 3 and that he
erroneously took this lor the adverb equivalent to mantum or quantopere.
Il Cicero bad found ὣς ἱιι the original, he would bave translated it by nt, as
he did in the phrase ol Protagoras in c. 23, 63.

On the law oi Isonomy cited by Velleius in 5 50 as an argument lor the
happiness and immortality oi the gods 1 bave expressed my doubts on p. 24.
lt Epicurus and the greater part of his followers did not make use ol this
law, it remains to inquire what other argument they did advance. There
are no express data on this point and we can only form conjectures. We
