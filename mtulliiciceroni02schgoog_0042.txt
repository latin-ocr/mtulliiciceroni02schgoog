believe in any gods, but only made a pretence of doing lo, in
order to avoid unpopularity(120-124).

This is the summary os the first boolr; a lew observations on the
Academic's criticism oi the theology oi Epicurus have been already
made in the notes3 but it may not be amiss to weigh it a little more
carelully. Any person possessing a moderate acquaintance with the
history oi ancient philosophy and the contests oi the various schools
knows that the fighting was not always done with sair weapons. but
that misrepresentation and unjust deductions from the adversaries'
propositions were not uncommon. There is no want oi this in

· Cotta's discourse. We must recognize the reproach as well founded
that the Epicurean theology undermined and destroyed all religion
worthy οἰ the name3 and when Epicurus notwithstanding this talked
of pious reverence for the gods because of their essential excellence,
we may at least doubt whether he was really in earnest. So sar as
we can see from the remains os his writings or those os his followers.
the idea of εὐσέβεια was limited simply to a belief in the immor·
tality and perfect happiness ol the gods. and the rejection os all
such conceptione as were inconsistent with it3 and these included
not only the mythological lables and many perverted and contra· ⁴
dictory notions of the common crowd. but the teachings oi other
philosophers as well, who ascribed to the gods the government oi
the world and a care lor earthlyand human affairs3 lor Epicurus
thought that this would give the gods an occupatiori so troublesome‚
burdensome and venatious‚ that such a thing as happiness would be
for them impossible. 1r the Epicrueans did not entirely withdraw
horn the traditional rites ol religion. they did so chiefly in order to
give no offense. which might perhaps have brought them into dan· ·
ger (Plutarch, Non possesuav. mhi etc.. c. 21); they did not disdain
even to hold the priestly offices (Lucian, conviv. s. Lapith.‚ c. 9) 3
and it is quite credible‚ as Cicero assures us (c. 30, 85), that many
oi them, however free-thinking they may have been in theory, were

·. yet in practice exceedingly superstitious. Similar contradictione be-

tween theory and practice have always been common in this matter.¹

¹ ln regard to Epicurus personally we may confidenrly assume that in spite
ol all breaking away lrorn religion in bis philosophical speculations be still had
a leading lo it et beart, ior there ere many signs ol it in his letters and lu
