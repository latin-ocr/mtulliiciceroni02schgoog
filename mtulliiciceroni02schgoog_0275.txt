with which it revolved. The clearest exposition oi the matter is given by
Schwegler on Aristot. Metaph. XII, 8, 12, p. 274 ff. Comp. also ideler ou
Arist. Meteor. 1, p. 418.

mensa et infinita vetustas ntentita sit.

Ihnve already said, 1 commence my discussion about the godhead, or na·

Zeno.

22 961. ignom essa artificiosum &c Diog. L. VII, 156: δοκεῖ et
αὐτοῖς (τοῖς Στωϊκοῖς) τὴνφύσιν εἶναι πῦρ τεχνικὸν 61ῖῲ βαδίζον εἰς γένεσιν,
ὀδῷ βαδίζον denotes a mode of operation constant, definite and designed‚
as also below c. 32, 81. In distinction from this πῦρ πχνικόν Zeno called
the earthly tire πῦρ ἄτεχνον, as Balbus above c. 15, 41 called it conjectaret
consumptor omnium. Stobae. Ecl. 1, p. 358. From another point oi view
AEschylus (Proin. v. 7) calls it πάντεχνον because oi its uset'ulness sor
variousarts.

96. 5. magistrum artium reliquarum. Apuleius (De Mundo,
Torn ΙΙ, p. 134 Altenb.) expresses the idea involved in this as follows:
Nam quid, oro te‚.ornatum atque ordinatum videri potest, quod non ab
ipsim (rnundi) exertaplo imitatura sit ratio? All artistic effort is a cre·
ation with intelligence and design aiter the example,of nature, which
creates with intelligence and design. Omnis ars est imitatio naturae,
Sencc. Ep. 65.

96. 6. omnis natura3 every force oi nature, acting in any portion oi
the universe or in any single being, in contrnst to the natura ipsius mundi,
the universal nature working throughout the universe. Comp. c. ιο, 28.

ne 96. 9. non artificiosa solum,sad plano artifex. The formeris
less than the latter ; artificiosus may be said of one who has a high degree
os skill without being a thorough artist, an artist by profession3 the latter
is the artistx, the artist in all that he undertakes.

96.11. ut caterae naturae . . . sio nutura mundi. Ut . . . sic
introduce not only parallel but contrasted expressions. (See Goerenz on
De Fin. 1, 1, 3.) As on the one hand the nature ol individual beings is
bound up in and conditioned hy their semina, their germs in which the
law oi their development is contained (in seminibus vis inest earum
rerum, quae ex iis progr'gnuntur, De Div. Ι, 56,128), so on the other
hand universal nature follows her own free and rational determination.
