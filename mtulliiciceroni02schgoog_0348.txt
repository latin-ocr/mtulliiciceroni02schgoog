Introduction, page 9. We are justified in ascribing personality to the ’

original deity oi the Stoics because he is endowed with consciousness, will
and wisdom; and we cannot conceive these attributes as existing indepen-
dently oi a personal being. But the Stoic deity is not on the one hand
simply immanent in the universe, like that of eone-sided pantheism3 nor
on the other a blind natural soree, the uncomprehended force ol atheisnrr
be pervades the'world, but is not lost in it and still remains exalted above
it. Oi course there is no question oi an absolute personality in the case
ol this deity, partly above the world, partly immanent in it, in lact the two
ideas ol the personal and the absolute are irreconcilable ς and the longer
we meditate on the nature and attributes os the deity, the more surely shall
we come to the conclusion ol Arnobius whose words are cited in the note
to 111, 15, 38. ⁸

That the Stoics were unable to conceive oi the deity as a purely imma·

the opposite opinion ; and so much the less will they be blamed sor con·
ceiving ol the matter os the divine being as ether, the source of light and
heat, since they were neither the first to hold such a view, nor have there
been wanting even in recent times men ol the greatest honesty and relig-
ious feeling who thought as they did.

Introal, pp. 11, 12. 1n Book 11, 6, 16 the Stoic says: Etenim si di nan
sunt, quid esse potest in rerum natura homine metirer? in ea enim sala est
ratio, qua nihil potest esse praestantius. Esse autem hominem, qui altit
r'n anani neurada melius esse paam reputet, derepientis adrogantiae est,·
erga est aliquid melius ,· est agitur prosecta deus. ’Πιο stoice rightly thought
it incredible that in this world emanated from the original deity man should
be the only being endowed with reason except the heavenly bodies, the
simple aspect of which seemed to show their etherial nature, and their won-
derful and regular movements to prove their intelligence. 'I'hey found
in the popular religion a belief in the existence ol other beings ol a
higher grade than man, although they could not assent to the conceptione
