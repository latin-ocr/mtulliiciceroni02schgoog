lt remains now to add something in regard to the persons whom
Cicero has introduced as advocates of the three schools oi philoso-
phy. We know little more oi the Epicurean Velleius, probably oi
lanuvium (see Orelli on 1, 29, 82). than that he was tribune oi the
people in the year 664. ln Dc Orat. 111. 21, 78, Cicero calls him a
familiaris oi the famous orator L. Licinius Crassus, but himself
rudem in dicendi mrcdatsone. We will not discuss the truth oi the
compliment that he was considered the most noted representative
among the Romans oi the Epicurean school. Lucretius, ol whom

'we have a didactic poem. excellent in its way, on the Epicurean phi·
losophy‚ was much younger than Velleius, but was no longer living
when Cicero wrote this.

We know no more oi the speaker for the Stoic school than we
leam from Cicero. It seems from a fragment oi the Ciceronian
Hortensius (Orelli, p. 484) that he' was also introduced in that
treatise as oue of the speakers.
