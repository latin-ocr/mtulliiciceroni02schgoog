chiefly leguminous plants; not however exclusively‚ but according to
Varro R. R. 1, 23, 2 those quere velluntur e terra, non subsecantur: quae,
quod ita leguntur, legumina dicta,· and 32, 22 dura a legendo, quod ea
non secantur sed vellendo leguntur. Gr. χέδροποι, χέδροπα or χέδροπες,
which is considered as a corruption of χέρδροποι, from χείρ and suno.

¹²9· ²3· nlsl torta . . . dubitationem adfert, quin . . . To under· {35⁸}
stand the clause with quin properly we must bear in mind that the sense
of the preceding one is: nam non rane dubitationem affert.

129. 27. bestius hominum gratim What the Academic might have
replied to this may be gathered, since the corresponding passage in the
third book is lost, from Porphyrius De Abst. 111, ω. See also what Celsus
says and what Origeu ctr. Cels. 1v, 74 answers.

129. 30· nequa ali . 0. potuissent. 'lhis pluperfect is often used in
this way instead of the imperfect, iuasmuch as the possibility of the thing
isrepresented as the condition which must be fulfilled before the thing
itself can take place. Comp. De Offic. Il, 3, 122 neque enim valetudinis

Ibid.c.4,15: quid enumerem artium multitudinem, sine quibus vita
omnino nulla esse potuisset. In the same way audire potuisses, above 1,
21, 57, is to be explained3 andri potuero, often used for si potero is to be

sheep not only would not now be able to exist and flourish, but would never
have been able to do so at any time, according to the original ordinance os

nature.

129.]35. se esse generatos. Eos would have been more correcte but
the reflexive is used because cenes, though not grammatically the subject,
is thought of as such, being implied in canum crestodia.

¹30· 4. ab filo aureo genere. Aratus, whom Cicero hus in mind lut
here, and from whom he quotes the following verses 130 ff, says of the
golden age, v. 1102 airus d ἔζωον, χαλεπὴ d ἀπέκειτο θάλασσα, καὶ βίον
οὔπω νῆες ἂπόπροθεν missuros, ἀλλὰ βόες noi ἄροτρα &cz but according to
others (as Hesiod W.& D. v. 1¹7³ Virgil, Georg. 1‚125; Ovid, Met 1,
