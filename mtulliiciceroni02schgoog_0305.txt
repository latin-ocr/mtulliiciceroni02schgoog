stantive itself, oculis, in its place may be compared with similar exemplos

[This passage is quoted by Isidorus, Etymolog. XI, 39 ed. Migne, and
runs thus: Munitae surrt autem (palpebrae) valla capillorum, ret et aper·
tis aculis, si quid inciderit, repellatur, et somna conniventibus, tanquam
involuti quiescant latentes. ln our text we have changed † utqui of Mlil·
ler and the Mss. to ut ii,-taking the sense of the passage to be this:

125. 17. nequid intrare possit, sl pateret. The elliptical expres· Ι

tive is used in all languages in such away that for the other side of the
comparison one must supply not a positive, but a negative. See Nitzsch on
Plato’s Ion, p. 66. Here we must supplement subtilius quam bestiae, quae
nibil subtiliter cernunt.

126. 1. tum venustatem. The tum is awkward because there is no
corresponding tum afterwards and it cannot be taken as correlative 1ο
the preceding primam, unless with Hand Turseli. Ι, p. 766 we strike out
the words colorum ctione et figurarum as a spurious addition. Perhaps
some old reader wrote on the margin tum for the following atque, and
copyists afterwards inserted it 10 the text in the wrong place. -1110 word
decentia is of Cicero’s coinage, as the ut ita dicam indicates, in order to
express the idea of εὐπρέπεια better than could be done by venustas and
ordo. [Schoemann reads et figierarum tum venustatem, the common read·
