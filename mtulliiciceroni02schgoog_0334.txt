dicebat belongs only to the relative clause and its subject L. Gellius ,· and
the authority of all the Mas. and the general connection of the passage
forbid our changing it to dicebant.

15316. culus in tutela Athenas. The allusion is to the Apollo
worshipped by the Athenians as πατρῷος, their tutelary deity ς he was after·
wards identified with the Pythian Apollo, the son of Zeira and Leto or La·
tona, but originally was certainly different. See Schoem. Opusc. Ac.1,
³24 ⁸¹¹d 347·

153. 20. Homolio. 'l'hisnametooisdoubtlesscorrupt3 but no certain
emendationispossible. The islands afterwards mentioned nre the Liparaean
or Aeolion, north of Sicily. The name Vulcaniae, Greek 'ueneritne had
perhaps fallen into dhuse in Cicero’s time ς hence he says nominabantur.

153. 22. Die matre· This is the reading of the best and the greater tt
number of Mra, not Ds'a. Cicero certainly did not find the, Latin name of
an agrarian deity in the writings of the Greek theologi whom he here fol·
lows. Serv. note on Aen. 1, 2975 IV, 577, and Ampelins c. 9, agree on
the reading Dic. Cf. also below c. 23, 59. 'lhe remarks of Welcker,
Griech. Giitterlehre 1, 329 in favor of Bia are notio the point.

153. 23. Valentis. Cicero apparently gives this as the translation of
the Greek name Ἰσχυς. According to the fable he was an Arcadian hero,
who won the favor of the Thessalian Coronis, which Apollo had enjoyed
before him. But Ischysis nowhere else mentioned as the father of Tropho-
nius. Cf. Miiller, Orchom, p. 196.

153. 28. [Aegyptum. Lactantius and Baiter 11 write a'n Aegyptum]

15319. Hunc Aegyptii 'l'heuth appellent. Cf. Parthey on Plnt
De Is. et Osir, p. 154 and R. Pictschnrann, Hermes Trismegistus (Iaeipsic,
mmmmmnm .

153. 34. cynosnrts. The reference is probably either to the Arca· o't
dian mountain vafoovpo, mentioned by Steph. Byz, or to a place in the
district of the Cynnraei, mentioned by Pausanias VIII, 27, 3.

154. 3. CorybantIs iilius. Apollo is sometimes called son of Cory-28
bas in other places; but his birth in Crete and his contest with Jupiter for
, the island are only mentioned here. As Corybas and the Corybantes orig·
inally belonged to the Phrygian mythology, and were from this adopted by
the Greeks especially in Samothrace and Crete, so this second Apollo owes
his existence doubtless to a combination of Phrygian and Greek fables; his
quarrel with Jupiter may have had reference to the coilisions of different
systema of worship. Cf. Hoeck’s Krete 111, p. 146.

154 5. ex Hyperboreis, ie. from the fabled Northern regions beyond

Boreas, where the Delphinus themselves were sometimes said to hare orig·
ioated. Cf. Miiller, Dorier fik. II, c. 4.
