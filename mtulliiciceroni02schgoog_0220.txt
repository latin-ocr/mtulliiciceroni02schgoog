BOOK I.—Ctutr. XXIII, XXIV, ἓξ 62-66. 207

Quo plebiscito decreta a senatu est consuli quaestio Cn. Caepioni (ann.
613); profectus in exilium Tubulus statim, nec respondere aruum· erat
enim res operta.¹' Cic. De Fin. 11, 16, 54.

Α 51. 6. Lupus. Perhaps L. Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, who was con·
sul in the year 579. That he was severely handled by the satirist Lucilius
is shown by Horace Sat. ΙΙ, 1, 683 and Pers. I, 1145 of the reason noth· -
ing is lsuown.

51. 6. Carbo (C. Papirius), the famous demagogue, and doubtless
the obJ'ect of attack on the part of the satirist for his demagogical doings.

51. 6. Neptuni flllus is equivalent to homo saevus et immanis accord·
ing to Gellius, N. Α. XV, 21, in allusion to Polyphemus, Cercyo, Sciron,
the Laestrygones and similar monsters which the myth spolie of as sprung
from Neptune. The aui of the Mss. is probably not genuine and the
expression denotes no other than Carbo; foc the idea, that the reference
is to some mythical bero, perhaps Cercyo, only deserves, to be mentioned
asacuriosity.

5¹· ¹4 atomorum . . ‚lieentia on account of the arbitrary declino· tu
tio atomorum, as Epicurus held it. See c. 25, 69. ·

5¹· 14· quodcumque tn solum ventt, “whatever comes into your
miuds.” 'Ibe origin of the expression is obscure. See wastinensi
IV, 347 ff·

5¹·15· Quae primum nullae sunt, i.e. the atoms. The primun
leuds one to expect a second proposition in regard to the atoma, which
however is wanting; it is clear too that the next sentence does not, as the
enim suggests, give a reason for the non-existence of the atoms. The pas·
suge is incomplete ; and the thought may be conjecturally supplemented
partly from Cicero himself (Acad. 1, 7, 27), as follows: quoe primunr
nullae sunt‚· nihil esi enim [in rerum notura minimum, quod dividi
nequeot‚· deinde, ut sint, moveri per inane non possunt, siquidem id dicis ·
inane] quod vocet corpore,· corporibus autem omnis obsidetur locus.
Comp. Schoemann Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 287.-Epicurus assumed as the
beginning offall things an empty space and atoms moving therein. Diog.
L. X, 403 and especially Lucret. 1, 500 ff. Other philosophers denied '
entirely the existence of un empty space. Stobaeus Ecl. 1, ¹9³ Plut.
Plac. Phil. 1, 18.

51.18. oraculntundo. See note to c. 16, 42. {f

51. 20. flagitia for opiniones flagitiosas, contemptu et vituperatione
dignos. So also ΙΙΙ, 38, 91. After the statement of these opinions the
thread of the discourse is resumed by hanc tu opinionem.

51. ao. [Democriti. See c. 43, 120 audacte]
