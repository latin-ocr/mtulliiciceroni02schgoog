Probably Epicurus did not say exactly ⁴wbat Cicero here states, but only
that the so·called principle exclusi tertii does not hold unconditionally‚
inasmuch as inaltemative propositions referring to the future it is quite
possible that neither ol the alternatives may be true. Comp. Prantl, Ge·
schicbte der Logilr 1, p. 4033 and Zeller 1112, 1, p. 391.

[Zeller 111¹, p. 233 thinks that Epicurus did not mean to impeach the
lonnal correctness ol the disjunctior, but only the material truth ol the two
propositions. He did not deny then that ol two contradictory cases one
or the other must occur, that the statement was true that ‘Epicurus will be
either alive or dead to·morrow’; but he denied only the trutlr ol the two
propositions each taken by itsell, i.e. he denied tlre truth ol the proposi·
tions ‘Epicurus will live,' and ‘Epicurus will not live,' because either one
becomes true only when the actual occurrence takes place]

52. 33. omnis sensus ver-l nuntios. Lucretius1V‚ 480rt. gives
Epicurus's reasons; namely that what is called illusion ol the senses is
not the fault ol the senses themselves, but ol a wrong interpretation ol the
sensuous impression; see ibid. 464 ff. . . .

52. 34. Nlhll . . . ntmts callido tor uhtredum or valde callide. So
non nimis tor “not extremely.” Cic. Diu. in Caecil. c. 22, 71 r Hoc statu·
ere, iudices, deletis, Caecilium non nimis honr causam severe, econ nimis
accurate, riori uineis diligenter acturum. Tusc. V, 33, 931 non nimir
sortasse subtiliter, utiliter torrem· Acad. ΙΙ, 47, 1461 nec tamen niteris
eleganter. ,

5 3. 1. durn lndlvlduornm corporum concretionem tuglt. Epi· tl
curus did not deny that the bodies ol the gods consisted ol atonis ς he
denied only the concretio, ie. the thicker, more compact constitution ol
their bodies. Comp. 27, 75. So sor example in 11, 39, 101 he opposes
concretus olr to fuscos et extenuatus,· crassum caelum atque concretum 11,
16 in.; pingue et concretum caelum, De Divin. Ι, 57, 1304 ‚nimis conmti
iuniores, below ΙΙ, 23, 59; terreno concretaque corpora, Tusc. Ι, 18,
42. But itis certainly untrue that Epicurus attributed to the gods this
finer, more subtle constitution ol body simply t'or the reason here assigned
by Cotta See Summam, p. 26, n. 1 3 and t'or the true reason see note to
c.18, .

534ζ. sed tamquam corpus, sc. essenii, supplied trom the preceding

Reguli, praeponendam tamen: a irequent ellipsis. So noto. . . secl, c. 7, ,

53. 4. Mirablle videtur lic. Comp. De Diva ΙΙ, 24, 51 where this 2ss
sentiment is assigned to the elder Cato.
