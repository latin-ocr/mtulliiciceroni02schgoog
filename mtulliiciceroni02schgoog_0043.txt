The other reproach made against Epicurus, that he did not in
reality believe at all in the existence oi the gods, plausible as it is,
we may reject as unsounded. lt is quite true that there was no
place ior the gods in his atomistic physics; and is he had contented
himself simply with explaining the origin os the world and natural
phenomena, he might or must have passed over the gods in silence,
as in sact he really does in the letter to Herodotus (Diog. L.. X,
45 ff.) which contains a short outline oi his physics3 it is only at
the end that he characterizes the notion osa govemment os the
world by happy and immortal beings as inadmissible. He wished
however to explain psychological phenomena, the facts presented by
the mind itseli3 and finding the belief in the gods a κοινὴ ἔννοια or
πρόληψις (see note on c. 16, 43), that is, a conception generally
prevalent, and, as it seemed, one naturally suggested, he found him-
self obliged to enter upon the subject. But his system recognized
no empty and purely subjective pictures os the iancy3 every'concep-
tion oi the mind must necessarily have come to it from outside,
and that in such a manner, that the atomic pictures affected the soul
either mediately through the senses, or immediately without their

. intervention. He could not then explain the conception os the

gods as an empty figment of the fancy3 it must have been due to
the aetion os atomic pictures upon the soul; and as the gods plainly
are not perceived with the physical senses, it resulted that the soul
must be directly affected by those pictures. But he was precluded
from explaining these as coming up by chance (ior such pictures
there were) because of their continued uniform repetition, this was
explicable only on the supposition that· they proceeded from an
object having real existence. Hence the gods must have a real ex·
istence. Furthermore since the κοινὴ ἔννοια represented the godsas
happy and immortal, and this conception was warranted by the law
oi isonomy, they must then in reality be so· Furthermore, because
. they not only differed from all other worldly beings in their immor·
tality, but also because os their happiness they could not possibly
have anything to do with the world and the cares ior worldly things,

other writings: his last dlrections iu regard to the ἐναγίσματα (Diog. L.¹ X, 18)
shows very well that he had not such unlimited confidence in his philosophical
doctrines as to conslder the traditional customs oi religion quite unreasouable.
