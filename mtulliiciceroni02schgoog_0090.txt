SUMMARY. 77

possessing intelligence and working with the highest skill and wis·
dom. The sum total 01 the universe too is subject to such a force
(δι-86). But no one who contemplates the world with its arrange·
ment can doubt that the nature which govems it 311 is really in the
highest degree intelligent and wise; he will be compelled rather to
recognize a being which manages and governs it wisely (87-90).-
Α The third argument is closely connected with the second, being
based upon the contemplation 01 the heavens and the heavenly
bodies in their wonderful order, harmony and beauty (91-129);
01 the different plants 3ηά beasts constituted and endowed with so
wondrous adaptatlon (121); 01 the manifold productions 01 the
earth conducing to the well-being of various creatures3 and 01 many
other things 01 the same sort which are given at great length
(iaz-132). Cicero omits, however, at the end to draw the definite
conclusion that there must be a divine providence which governs
the world. He assumes rather as a matter 01 course that all this
is the work 01 the gods, 3ηά draws simply the conclusion that the
gods could only havecreated the world ior the sake ol thinking,
reasoning beings‚ that is, for themselves and ior mankind (122);
this is directly lollowed by the proof 01 the especial care 01 the gods
ior men. The argument consists 01 3 minute description 01 the
wise arrangement and adaptatlon 01 the human body (134-149),
· and the facilities it gives rnen ior procuring their pleasures and sat-
, isfying their wants (150-152)3 especial weight is laid upon reason,
which distinguishes man from all other earthly beings‚ and which
enables him to contemplate the heavens and attain to knowledge 01
> the gods;¹ from this come piety and all the other virtues which
make man so like the gods that they excel him in hardly anything
but immortality. All this cannot possibly be the result 01 chance.
Balbus here nominally begins the lourth part or the prooi that
men enjoy the particular care 01 the gods, although what has just
preceded might with equal propriety have been arranged under
this head. lt was,¹ however, so closely connected with the third
part that it was drawn into that portion 01 the discussion. Balbus
shows here, in addition, that the whole arrangement of the world,
from the heavenly bodies and the succession ol the seasons and
weather resulting from their motion to the earth with its maniiold
products, is evidently intended ior the advantage 01 man (154—162).
