300 Notus,

145. 14. nullum est eorum, referring to the preceding amne animal,
equivalent to amnia animatia, a constructio ad sensnnu So in De Fin. IV,
nn, 57: maeque amnis controversia aut de re soleat autde nomine esse,
utraque earum nascitur din-On patibula see note on ΙΙ, 39, 98. Cicero
uses it in passive sense, Tusc. IV, 23, 51 ; but not elsewhere.

145. 16. et sl omno animal talo est, ie. ferendi et patiendi necessi·
tati obnoxium. This sentence with the conclusion drawn from it is for
the moment put in hypothetical form, to be repeated afterwards with atqui
in a positive form; and the mortality, the divisibility and the destructibility
of all living things then follow asa mntternf course. - Moreover in this
series of propositione the first, si nullum eorpus inmortale sit 111, secans to
be superfluous in so fai that no especial application is made of it to the
mortality of the animatia ,· if there had been, it must have been put in be·
tween the first and second proposition, somewhat in this ways ergo cum
nullum animai sit nisi corporeum, consequitur etiam animat nullutn in·
mortale esse. But Cotta might omit this as a thing to be taken for granted.

145. 17. Ergo itidem. Ergo seems to imply that the divisibilityis a
consequence of the serendi et patiendi necessitas just mentioned, which
would hardly be granted without qualification ; ergo then would have been
better left out. Τ111 opinion of some, that ergo may be equivalent to deinde,

is properly rejected. See Hand Turseli. 11, p. 464-’1111 following sen.
tence would be better omitted as it only repeats what has just been said

no 14514 slmlllter igitur. This igitur joina the conclusion with the

111

preceding protasis introduced hy si. So below 5 33. Comp. De Invent.
1, 34, 69 1 quodsi metius gubernantur ea, quae consitaque quae sine
consilio administrantur, nihil autem amasium rerum melius administra>
tur quam omnis mundus ,· consilio igitur mundus administratur.

145·24· ⁰¹¹¹¹¹¹⁸ [illm eliuth 1 quibus cuncta constant. If tt·
cero really wrote thus, sunt cannot be taken as the verbum existentiae and

as a complete predicate3 for in that case amnia quae sunt would mean
“ all that exists,’' which is plainly not intended herc; sunt must therefore

be taken as the copula, and the sense must be omnia quae sunt cuncto·
rum elementa. But the strange form of expression is a very improbable
one3 Cicero probably wrote: si omnia,e quitus, quae sunt, cuneta con·
stant‚· or the words quae sunt should be crased.

145. 29. Etenim omne corpus . . . 'l'hls sentence does not give the

reason of what immediately precedes, but that of the proposition: nauta·
bilia sunt omnia.

146. 7. sentit igitur . ..dulcln ot amara. Carneades in Sext.
Emp. tx, 139: ei γὰρ rial 11111, (bariona ei tt 1116111111, αἰσθάνονται.
