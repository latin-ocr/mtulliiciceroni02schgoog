mutuo for [multum] and remarksz] instead of mutuo perhaps multum
should be read; the Mss. have multum. [Kayserz motu lunae, apud
Baiter ΙΙ.]

121. 29. montes vestiti atqua silvestrem the second expression to
dehne more nearly the first. Comp. c. ⁶4, 161: vestitusque densissimos
montium. . ⁴
121. 31. [For utilitates, a conjecture of H. A. Koch, Schoemann
reads dotes.]-dotes dentque innumerabiles, “in short, gitis without .
number ” with which the earth is provided, and which serve mankind partly
for nourishment and partly for other necessities of life (ad vietum etad
vitam). Denique is regularly used to close with a general and compre·
hensive term an enumeration of several particulars. - artes, which is the
reading of the Mss. for dotes, is an error ir1 copying which often occurs; .
see Schoem. Opusc.Ac. 111, 340 3 had Cicero mentioned the arts here, he
would have erred in putting together things which should remain distinct.
For the arts are invented by man; this capacity of inventionis all that
natine has given him; they should therefore not be thrown together with
the salutary and useful phenomena and products of nature, which by their
dotes, the propertius with which nature has endowed them, are useful and
valuable to meu. Moreover the arts are afterwards mentioned in their
proper place, c. 59, 148. Dotesis precisely the word for the sense required
here. [Dotes is a conjecture of Schoemann.]

54 122. ¹5· os . . . spiritu augetur, “the mouth is gifted with breath ”3

¹⁸⁴ for augeri aliqua re is never used except of things which are to one’s

advantage, useful or agreeable. But the old physiologists themselves
would hardly have acknowledged that the breath was especially of advan-
tage to the mouth 3 rather as Cicero himself says, c. 55, 136, the breath is
the cibus animalis, quo vtaxime aluntur anirnantes.

122. 17. [For [ab lls] Schoernann writes ab his without brackets and
gives this note a] manditur ab his. abhis might have been left out here,
but still it is defensible. See Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 372·

122. 18. adversi dentes are the front teeth, as adversum corpus the
front of the body.

ιω 122. 21. stomachus, the oesophagus3 not the stomach proper, bulthe
way to it. celsus IV, 1: deinde duo intinere incipiunt: alterum aspe· ’
ram arteriam nonrinant, alterum stomachum: arteria exterior ad pul· ’
atonem, stantachus interior ad ventriculum fertur.

122. 22. tosillas, tonsils, the glands at the back of the mouth at the
commencernent of the oesophagus. Colles faucium spectantes uvam (the
uvula), Lact. De Opil. Dei, c. 11, 9.
