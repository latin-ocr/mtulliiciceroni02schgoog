80. 33. C. flaminius (Nepos), “contra auspicia profectus, signis mili·
taribus effossis, quartalli non potuerant, et ao equo, quem conscenderat,
per capnt devolutusw ,al Hannibale ad Trasimenum lacum caesus est.”

Caelica Antipater, an annalist of the first halfof the seiinth century, who

Boissier, litudes sur Varron, p. 297.

81. 4 acnuam Comp. Livyl, 36, where heis called inclitus eae
tempestate augur, i.e. in the time of Tarquinius Priscus. lt is an error of
memory that Giccro mentions Hostilius here ς in other passages, De Repub.
ΙΙ, 20, 36 and De Div. I, 17, 31 where the same story is told in more de·
tait, he gives it correctly. '

81. ιο. pcremnla, auspices takm at the naming oia risen

81. ιι. ex acuminibus, “auspicium totum militarc” says Cicero
De Div. Il, 36, 77. But it is impossible ιο ascertain with certainty what is
to be understood by acumina, whether the points of lances on which elec·
tric flames were sometimes seen, or the tongued flames of the sacrificial fire,
or the points of the beaks of the birds, or what not. See the citations in
Giese and Moser, Cic. De Div, p. 293· ’

81. ιι. nulla, eum vlrl vocantur. The nulli viri vocantur of
the Mss, which no one has ever been able to explain (comp. Schoem.
Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 275), must necessarily be thus amended. Gellius XV,
27, 3 expresses the idea more fully: cum viri ad praelium faciendam in
aciem vocabantur. While the army was forming in line of battle the gen-
eral took the auspices: is opud quem in exercitu auspicinmimpcrinmqrce

Veron. on Virg. Aen. X, 241. When the soldiers were arranged in battle
array, in procinctu, they occupied the time while the general was taking
the auspices in making their wilh before three οι four of their compacionss
interim ea mora utebantur qui testamenta in procinctu facere volebant,
says Sabidius in loco. Α will made under such circumstances without
, further formalities (sine libra atque tabulis, De Orat. Ι, 53, 228) was·
legally valid. When the taking of the auspices fell into dbuse the testa·
menta in procinctu also ceesed, as there was no time for making them
This incidental remark may be bere superfluous; but ίι need not for that
reason bave been regarded by the critiesassnspicious. Itistobeconsidered
in the same way as the similar remarks 11, 36, 915 43,111; ΙΙΙ, ιο, 25.
Thr opinion of some that the testamento in procinctu had not fallen into
disuse in Cicero's time is without foundation.
