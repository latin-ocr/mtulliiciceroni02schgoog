¹ 89, 32. Seite enim Chrysippus. The sense ot the argument which 14
Cicero does not bring out very clearly is doubtless this: All which simply
serves something else as a means to an end is not absolutely, but only rela-
tively perfect. The universe alone, since it comprehende everything within
itsell and so serves nothing else asa means, is its own end and absolutely
perient. Hence that cannot be wanting to it without which it would not ⁴
be absolutely perfect, namely, reason. - On onim see note c. 16 init.

9o.15. efficitur tomen in homino virtus. The general idea oi tt
virtus according to De Leg. l, 8, 22 is nihil aliud quam in se perfecta
et ad summum perducta natura, the complete development of all the
faculties and capacities of any being ard ri riv alone of Aristotle. Such
virtus is realized (efficitur= ad effectam perducitur) in mun, i.e. in the
