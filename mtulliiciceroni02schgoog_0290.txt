108.10. Aristoteles. No passage corresponding to that quoted 10 ae
the text is found in the extant writings 01 Α11210112; yet Sext. Ernp. IX, 22
cites the following passage 01 hisi θεασάμενοι γὰρ prb ἡμέραν μὲν ῆλιον
περιπολοῦντα, 111111ορ δὲ τὴν 21111111το1 τῶν ἄλλων ἀστέρων atomon, ἐνόμισαν

108. 32. 0112201110 viderent. [521020120012262111110111111,2011
says] the Mes. all have quae cum viderent. Ι1 Cicero really wrote thus,
he must 10 his haste have lost sight 01 the construction 01 the sentence,
which is in itseli not impossible. lt is still quite as 111-01121112 11121 112 wrote·
neither baec nor quae, and that the words eum viderent went with immu-
tabilis 11111111, and that the conclusion 01 the sentence commenced with
profecto. ‘lhat is Madvig's opinion. [Mliller prefers to suppose that at
the end 0120 long a passage Cicero changed the construction and wrote
quae than that the copyists changed baec 1010 quae, 01 themselves interpo-
lated the quae. Baiter 11 brackets the quaa]

109. 15. heras, 1.2. horarium or horologium. It would be difficult to w
find other examples 01 boras 10 11112 signification, except perhaps 10 the
expression ad boras mittere, Cic. Brut c. 34, 200 r “ to send some one to
10011 21 the clock”; Petron. c. 71: boras inspicere. The words macli-
natione quadam show that 2 111111211ἰί2 clock is alluded to.
