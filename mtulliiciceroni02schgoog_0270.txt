91.26. nequo naturum significan. .“ points neither to a mere force
of nature‚” ie. a blind and unconscious force. For tbis signification of tbe
word, which the connection absolutely requires, comp. c. 32, 81 ς Ι, 13, 35;
and ΙΙΙ, 11, 27. Significare is used in the same way c. 22, 54: 'ergnr'fieant
eandem mentem atque prudentiam and c. 33, 85: tantam naturae. sol·
lertiam significat,⁸ declarare in tbe same sense is found in c. 32, 81.. .

91. 30. aut natura aut vl aut voluntate. lt is plain that natura tt
bere denotesthe force of nature that works unconsciously in everytbing,
vis a force that operates from without, to both these is opposed the motion
resulting from free will and inherent power. This view of Aristotle, as well
as that cited above 5 42, occurred doubtless in the dialogue arpi φιλοσοφίας.
Νο passage that exactly corresponds is found in his extant writings, but iu
De Caelo ΙΙΙ, 2 he saysr ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἢ βίαιον εἶναι τὴν κίνησιν ἢ rard φῦσιν.
In the same work I, 2 however he distinguishes a motion of three kinds,
ivri τὸ μέσον, ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσον, περὶ τὸ μέσον. 'ibe last, the circular motion, is
by nature peculiar to what be calls the πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, and what others
call aether ,· the heavens and the heavenly bodies are composed of iltis
πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, their motion being so far a natural one, and yet withal
a voluntary'one3 this is to be understood of the planels. ’ ·

91. 33. [in] sublima. The preposition probably was added by copy·
ists, who were unacquainted with the adverbial use of sublime. Comp.
Priscian XVII, 1, 11 and the citatione of Kiihner, Tusc. Ι, 17, 4ο. ,

92. ¹5· certa notlona animi praesentimus· This expression, like ω
the following praesensionem notionemque nostram, refers to the πρόληψις,
which the Stoica believed ln, lilre the Epicureans. · See note I, 17, 44 and
14, 37. Itis a φυσικὴ ἔννοια (Diog. L. VII, 54), which arises in the mind

without particular teaching or reflexion, dvrv διδασκαλίας καὶ ἐπιμελείας, in
a natural and simple manner, ἀνεπιτεχνήτως. Plut. Plac. Phil. IV, 11. In
another passage, De Stoic. Rep. c. 17, these προλήψεις are also called ipen
ror· in the same sense as Cicero callsthem innatas c.4,12.-Man has

then a natural preconceived notion of the divine nature, and is convinced
of the substantia} trnth of this notion immediately, intuitively, and without
proof 3 and he admits the truth of any further scientilic idea of the divine
nature only in so far as he finds it to correspond to this preconceived
notion, so far as he can bring it into harmony with that; this Cicero ex·
presses below by accommodare: comp. Orat. c. 7, 232 unum (Demosthe-
nem) accommodare ad eam, quam sentiam, eloquentiam.

’ 92. 18. primum hunc ipsum mundum. The corresponding deinde
iswanting. ‘Ibe heavenly bodies evidently would come next; but in the
tirade against Epicurus Cicero forgets so entirely tbe form of the sentence,
