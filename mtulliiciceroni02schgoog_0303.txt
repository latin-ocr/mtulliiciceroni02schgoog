exspirantes because this isordinarily used only of dying. Respiratus can

’ only mean iu this passage intrating the air, aud so differs from respirare
iu the passages above referred to. The form respiratus isfound elsewhere
only in Apulei. Met. 1v, ¹5 1 parvis respiratui circa nares et oculos datis
fhraminibus; where, as is seen, the breathing in general is spoken of, like
,the Gr. 1111111011, Madvig conjectures intrante spiritu for in respiratus.

[The passage is singularly confused. Dr. Kilhner (Wesen der Giitter,
Uebers. u. Eski, p. 228 note) considers adspiratione aeris in 33, 83 as
clearly meaning the inhalation of the air. If we suppose Cicero in the
present passage to have stated the facts correctly‚ he must mean by adspi-
rantes “exhaling‚” and by in respiraeu ‘⁸ inhaling the 111 ”; and if so,·he
uses the terma very carelessly. Dr. Klihuer however thinks that he used
the terms in the usual sense, and misunderstood the facts ; that is, that he
really thought the lungs contracted by inhalation, and expanded by exhala-
tion. Prof. Schoemann in his second edition seems to think that the terma
are used in the ordinary sense, but that Cicero from mere carelessness says
the contrary of what he should have said] 3

the left chamber of the heart, and passed from thence into the arteries.
Galen iu a special essay proved that the arteries also contained blood.
