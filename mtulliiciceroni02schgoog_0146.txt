SUMMARY.

BEFORE giving his objections to the doctrines of the Stoics as
expounded by Balbus Cotta expressly defends himself against
the suspicion of not believing the religious· faith handed down from
' former times. He believes it, he says, thoroughly3 but to him
religion is only a matter of faith, not of knowledge, and his objec-
tions are directed solely against the attempt of the Stoic to change
this saith into knowledge by means of rational proof. He cannot
allow any conclusive 'force to the arguments adduced by Balbus
(551-5). He then commences the discussion in detail, and first
takes up the proofs for the existence of the gods. Balbus had said
that, properly speaking, no proofs of it were necessary, and yet had
attempted to give them, in reality however he had only made the
matter more doubtful. He had appealed to the popular belief, with·
out really agreeing with that belief himself ς moreover such an ap-
peal cannot pass, says Cotta, for a scientific argument (6-10). The
pretended instances of apparitione of the gods, and all that Balbus
had said about revelation by the auspices, can make no claim to cer·
tainty or to be received as valid proof ( rr-r 5). This is sufficient
to refute the first part of Cleanthes's argument which is also based
on revelation. The second part, which appealed to the impression
made by the gigantic phenomena of nature, is met by the remark
that, although the common people regard these as the operatione
of divine beings, it by no means follows that they really are such
(16,17). The two remaining parts are reserved for the portion
of the argument on the divine providence3 this however is no
longer extant. For this portionis also reserved the discussion of
the arguments of Chrysippus, of the syllogisms of Zeno and the
