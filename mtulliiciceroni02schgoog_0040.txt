sunnam. 27

Moreover Epicurus ought properly to have said, not that the gods
had the somn ol men, but that men had the form ot' gods, because
the gods, as being immortal‚ must have existed before men.¹ Or
else he must have assumed that, when the human race came into
being, chance which brought the atoms together made such a won-
derful hit that men sprang up similar to the gods3 and it would not
be worth the trouble to argue against this (89, 90). But further·
more, the human form would be quite useless to the gods, because
they have not the same uecessities and occupations to which tbe
human organisation is adapted (91-94). And if tlrc human iorm is
still insisted upon ior the gods, because without it they cannot pos·
sess reason, and hence cannot be happy, the objection must be
repeated that it isidle to maintain that reason can only exist'in
union with the human form because we have never seen it j0ined
with any other, and on the other hand not to see how absurd it is
to attribute to the gods limbs and organs ior which they can have
uo possible use, being according to Epicurus entirely without activity
of any sort; aview, be it observed‚ which strips the gods oi that
very thing which in reality is essential to any happiness (ος-102).

Suppose we grant that the gods have the human iorm3 where do
th'ey live? Do they ever change their abode? And why? Have ⁴
they any impulses at all i Do they make any use oi their reason?
, Lastly. ou what ground are they called immortal and happy i- The
only answer the Epicureans have forali these questions is to talk

l'Ihe Academia here takes ''immonni'’ (aeterni) as importing “without
beginning '¹ as well as “without end.'' But Epicurus only spoke oi the lite ol
tha gods as being endless and imperishable‚ which was also the popular belief:
he considered the gods not as without beginning, but as having come into being·
ln order, il not to prove, at least to render this immortality possible and credi·
ble, he had recourse to the law ol isonomy, which required imperishable as the
counterpart to perishable beings. Admitting the gods however to have had a
beginning, he was not at all obliged to assume that their existence was prior to
that ol the human race. Moreover the assumption that the gods bad the
human lorrn did not necessarily involve the other, that their iorrn was imitated
from it, but only that it was similar to the human lorrn. This similarity he
maintained to be a fact oi universal consciousness. in virtue oi the πρόληψις
resulting irom the impressions coming to us irom the gods: he added other
reasons only as cumulative arguments. When his adversaries regarded this
similarlty as a wonderful lrealt oi chance, he hardly needed to mind it; lor, so
long as the fisci was established, he could notbe expected to explain the reason.
