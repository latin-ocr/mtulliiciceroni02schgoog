10 DE NATURA DEORUM.

more perfect beings, of purer etherial substance, without gross
bodies, sinless and wise from the beginning3 these are the gods
(see ll, 13, 35). Considered in this respect the theology oi the
Stoics may be characterized as a monotheism and a polytheism
combined. For the one being, whence everything has proceeded,
is alone God in the true sense oi the word, uncreated, imperishable,
and eternal. The other gods are not eternal, but created ,and per·
ishable beings, that at the universal dissolution of all things will
return into the primaeval being whence they came. Further, in the
recognition by the Stoics of different sorts ol such created gods we ,
may recognize on the one hand a logical deduction irom their specu·
lative physics, on the other only a concession to the popular saith.
ltlollowed from their physical views ol the constitution of the firc-
like ether, that they also had to explain the constellatione, which
consisted ol it, to be gods. But when they accepted gods that
were only deilied mortals, or gods only as originators and con·
trollers oi certain human relations and moral lorces, or as givers of
various gilts, they evidently only followed the popular belief ; and
so in Cicero's account of their doctrines (ll, 23, 60) we do not find, as
iu the case ol the highest deity and os the constellations, a demon·
stration of the existence of these gods, but only the simple remark,
that such deities were accepted by wisc men not without reason.
The same is the case with the gods which we may designate as
natural spirits, which bear rule in various parts oi the world, the,
earth, the sea, the tire, dcc. The Stoics accepted these too, because
they found the belief in them among the people, and because they χ
felt obliged, not to reject: but rather to recognize a sort ol natural ,

revelation in the popular saith, so lar as it contained nothing contra·
dictory to reason, nothing plainly false and perverted. But it can· ,
nothe ignored, that all these deities occupied an uncertain and am·
higuous position in their system os theology3 and il we had hiller
accounts than have actually come down to us ol the views oi indi·
vidual Stoics, we should doubtless lind not only that they had dil·
·. iered among themselves on this point, but that the same thinker had
not always consistently held the same opinion. The Stoics were
reproached by their antagonists with believing that the popular gods
were such only in name, not in reality; partly because they repre-
sented them as created and perishable beings, and conceded immor·
tality only to theone highest being, whom it is true they called
