Cotta¹s ans'wer is lost· the portion that remains goes to prove that divina-
tion, even ιι ιι were any thing more thau a figment of the hrain, would still
be of ιιο use to rnen, because what was destined to happen would happeri
at any rate and could not be avoided by knowing it beforehand. This
argument ιι also found De Div. 11, 8, ao.

141. ι, fissum leoorlst probably a fissure or cut separating the dif-
ferent lobes of the liver, called linies in Seneca OEd. 365. Ἱιιο ¹fissura
denoted good or evil fortune according to the circumstances; there was =a
fissum virale, a fissum familiare, and other similar sorts. See De Div. ιι,
6, 12. 133 Brisson. De Form. Ι, 31; Mtlller Etruslr. 11, 182. ⁴

141. 4 sortls, such as were used in the temple of Fortuna at Prae·
neste for divination; they were countem, which when mixed like a paclr
ol cards were thrown into a vase, and one or more were drawn ont.

not all of the same kind, and those expressions do not have the same mean·

141. 22. formatas ιὀι informatas, more common in this sense, which¹ ⁷
was also used above ιι, 5, 13. —The following repetitionof the reasons¹⁸
adduced by Cleanthes changes the order there followed, putting the third
before the second ι evidently because Cotta after answering the argument
from divination wishes now to treat only the third, that drawn from the Ι
wonderful and awe-inspiring phenomena of nature, leaving the second and
fourth for a later part of the discourse when he means to spealr of the
divine providence‚ the same arguments being applicable to both. He thus
avoids repeating the same thing as Balbus did That portion of Cotta's
discourse ιι however lost.
