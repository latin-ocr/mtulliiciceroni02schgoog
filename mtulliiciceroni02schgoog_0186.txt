mentioned just below, is to be regarded as a desertor of the Academy.

aud left him a considerable property at his death.

34. 19. Pnno of Larissa, au Academicum during the Mithridalic war
in 666110111 Athens to Rome, where Cicero, as he himself says Brut. 89,

306, totum se ei tradidit. He was the last representative of any note of
the Academic philosophy. Philone uiuo patrocinium Academiae non
defuit says Cic. Acad. II, 6, 17.

3419. Antiochus of Ascalon, a disciple of Philo, but nothis suc·
cessor. He abandoned the Academic scepticism and devised for himself
an eclectio, dogmatic system composed of Platonis, Aristotelic and Stoic
tenets taken together. Comp. Acad. II, 22, 69; and especially Madvig,

No notice has come down to us of the'muny whom Cicero here speaks of.
We know indeed that several of his contemporaries wrote in Latin on
philosophical topics, for example P. Nigidius Figulus and M. Terentius
Varro, not to speak of the poet Lucretius; but they were not induced to
do so by Cicero's example any more than the Epicureans Amafinius,
Rabirius and Catius, whom he mentions disparagingly. Acad. 1, 1, 5;
Tusc. IV, 3, 6; Ad Famil. XV, 16, 13 19, 1. Perhaps however Brutus
and Plancus mentioued by Quintilian X, 1, 123 aud C. Asinius Pollio were
among those whom he has in mind.
