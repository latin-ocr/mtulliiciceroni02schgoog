= clearly. lt is not e'a spite as his real ability, that he has made such an
argument, but because his ability, however great people thought it, was even
still greater than the common opinion. The excellence of his argumenta·
tion therefore was to be opposed not to his ability itself, but to the common
opinion uf his ability, somewbat thum quamquam accerrimo esse ingenio
credatur, tamen, quae dicit, eiusmodi sunl &ci Whether the argumenta·
tion really required so much keenness is another question; however that
may be, it had already been made before Chrysippus by Cleanthes as may
be seen from Sext. Emp. IX, 83.

[According to the preceding note the drift of the sentence would be ¹
that Chrysippus in the argument that follows showed himself to be cleverer
than he was generally thought to be. But taking the language as ir stands
the opposition would rather seem to be between acerrima ingenio and ab
ipsa natura,· “although he is 'a man of very keen mind and so quite able
to construet a perfectly sound and convincing argument, yet the argument
which he actually makes on this point is so sublime that you would think
he had ‘horrowed a leaf from the book of nature,’ and not have found it
out himself.” The point of the remark is then not the greater or less
keenness of Chrysippus, but the soundness and beauty of the argument;
and in the mouth of a Stoic this seems more natural than a very dubious
compliment to Chrysippus]

83. 20. (a) quo illa conficiuntur. 'lhe preposition, wanting in
almost all Mas, is as indispensable here as before homine in the preceding
sentence. Comp. Hand Tursell. I, p. 31 f.·, and below 111, 10, 25 where
the same argument is made in somewhat different language.

’ 83. 26. desipientis adrogantiae. Comp. De Leg. 11, 7, 162 quid
est enim verius, quam neminem esre oportere tane stulte adrogantem, uf in
se rationem et mentem patet inesse, in eaelo mundoque non putet?

83. ²9· [A. du Mesnil in Fteckeimn’s Jahrb. 1877, p. 760 proposes
to atrike out the non: Mtiller (Adnotat. Crit.) approves, adding: 'l‘he
sentence is negligently writteny ir should run either thus: An. . ,ῥοαῖς
adduci, ut pedes,- tantum ergo ornatum . . . nonne desipere videare? or
thus = Aa . . . nom possis adduci, respectes ,· tantum ornatum . . . uf tuum

83. 30. et mustella. The ancients kept weasels as well as cats in ιτ
their houses for the destruction of mice. Oomp. Phaedr. Fab. 1, 223 Peri·

83. 34. omnia supera esse meliora. This sentence leads usto
expect a line of argument similar to that in Sextus Enp.1x,86u.= namely
that the beings who live in the higher regions of the universe must be of a

higher, superhuman nature, aud therefore gods. Instead of this however
