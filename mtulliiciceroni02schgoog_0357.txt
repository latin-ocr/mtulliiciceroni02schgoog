the perception which results from the influence ol the impressions may be
seen irom the letter oi Epicurus to Herodotus,§ 68, where those things
which are perceived by the senses are called γνωστὰ rur Δοθησινς and in
the letter to 1111011115 123 the perception ol the gods through theimpres·
sions is called γνῶσις ἐναργής, whereas the proper understanding oi the
nature ol the gods can only be reached by rellection and reason, the gods
are only λόγῳ θωρητοί.- Finally the words ἐπὶ τὸ airh ‹irorrrellemrhw
certainly mean that the impressions all have the same eiiect (111 rd αὐτὸ

ception. Because Cicero, Sallust and the older authors in general only
use utique in passages where a relative or interrogative pronoun precedes,
qul ubique and the lite, and because it very olte'n seems as ii ubique in
such passages were equivalent to et ubi, Lachmann, Lucret. lv, 638, p. 251,
has stated with his usual confidence that in the older language and even in
Cicero's time ubique could nowhere be used in any other sense, and that
it was a gross imperitia to suppose that it could as well be used in the
seme manner as the other words compounded with the indefinite que, undi-
que, usque, uterque dre. (a usage which still occurs in Horace, eg. Sat. 11,
5, 23). The fact in regard to Cicero and the older writers had been ob-
served hy others long before Lachmann3 ci. Duker De Latinit. vert.
1. Ctors, p. 415 (380 ed. lips). We may concede that in very many places
where ubique occurs niter a pronoun it may be perfectly well taken ior et
ubi: but that in any passage whatever it can be taken only in this way
