91. 26. neque naturam significat,v .“ points neither to a mere force
of nature,” ie. a blind and unconscious force. For this signification of the
word, which the connection absolutely requires, comp. c. 32, 81 ; 1, 13, 353
and 111, 11, 27. Significm is used in the saum way c. 22, 541 “ significant
eandem mentem atque prudentiam ,· and c. 33, 851 tantam naturae. rol·
Iertiam regnificnt,· declarare in the same sense is found in c. 32, 81.. ,

91. 3ο. aut natura aut vl aut voluntate. Itis plain that natura 11
here denotes the force of nature that works unconsciously in everything,
vis a force that operates from without; to both these is opposed the motion
resulting from free will and inherent power. This view of Aristode, as well
as that cited above ξ 42, occurred doubtless in the dialogus περὶ φιλοσοφίας.
Νο passage that exactly corresponds is found in his extant writings, but in
De Caelo 111, 2 he says: ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἢ βίαιον εἶναι τὴν κίνησιν ἢ κατὰ phorm
In the same work Ῑ,2 however he distinguishes a motion of three kinds,
ἐπὶ πὸ μέσον, ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσου, περὶ τὸ μέσον. 'Ibe last, the circular motion, is
by nature peculiar to what he calls the πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, and what others
call aether: the heavens and the heavenly bodies are composed of this
πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, their motion being so far a natural one, and yet withel
a voluntary'one3 this is to be understood of the plancis. ’ ·

91. 33. [11] sublime. The preposition probably was added by copy·
ists, who were unacquainted with the adverbiaf use of sublime. Comp.
Priscian XVII, 1, 11 and the citations 'of Kiihner, Tusc. 1, 17, 40. ,

92. ¹5· certa notioneanlml praesentimus. ‘Ihis expression, filie¹45⁷
the following praesensionem notionemque nostram, refers to the πρόληψις,
which the Stoice believed in, like the Epicureans. · See note 1, 17, 44 and
14, 37. It is a φυσικὴ ἔννοια (Diog. L. vn, 54), which arises in the mind
without particular teaching or reflexion, dvev διδασκαλίας καὶ ἐπιμελείας, 11

then a natural preconceived notion of the divine nature, and is convinced
of the substantial truth of this notion immediately, intuitivefy, and without
proof 3 and he admits the truth of any further scientific idea of the divine
nature only in so far as he finds it to correspond to this preconceived
notion, so far as he can bring it into harmony with that; this Cicero ex·

tirade against Epicurus Cicero forgets so entirely the form of the sentence,
