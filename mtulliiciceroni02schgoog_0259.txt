punt. The protasis is contained in simperto: nisipascatur.

11 9⁰· 32. confector consonanterque. 'lhe second word serves to
define the fiat, which of itself alone might be ambiguous. conflarit
rerum omnium vetustas is cited from (icero by Iamantins VII, 11, ς.

90. 34. ille corporeus, ie. qui ert in corporibus ,· although iu other
places the word rather means “corporeal,” corpore praeditarum also in
Cicero 'limae e. 4 and 8. 01 the other hand iu De lin. 111, 14, 45 rer
corporeae are bodily endowments‚ as benith, beauty 111.- 11 is hardly
necessary to remark that ignis corporeus here is quite the same with iic
noster calor above 1 30, the heat which gives life and growth to all earthly
creaturos. This comes from the ardor caelestis, the ether of the highest
regions, where it is pure and nnmixed with grosser matter. Cicero uses
ardor for the Greek didio (from aido); and Balbus below c. 36, 91 thinks
it necessuy to make a sort of excuse for employing it as being less current
iu latin. ,

91. 5. 11 quidem, here equivalent to et profecto,- an addition with

11 91. 8. Arlctotell videtur. No such remark is to befound in the
estam writings of Aristotle3 but the Ps. Plutarch (Plac. Phil. V, ao) saysr

9¹· ¹3· 111 111 sensum 1111110810. , lt would have been more correct'
and more adapted to the purpose of the argument, had Cicero written: in
iis sensum acerrimum inesse et intellegentiam celei-rimam.

111 91.15. Etenim llcot vidoro. Etenim introduces not a reason‘for
the proposition immediately preceding, which, as following from undis-
puted premises, needed no further reason, but rather a reason in addition
to those already brought forward; itis therefore a new link in the chain
of reasoning, and would have been introduced quite ns well at least by .
porro or praeterea. Cicero often uses etenim and enim in this way.
Comp. Madvig De Fin. 1, 1, 3. 'l'he warrant for this usage is to be found
in the real meaning of enim, which originally was not camative but only
asseverative.
