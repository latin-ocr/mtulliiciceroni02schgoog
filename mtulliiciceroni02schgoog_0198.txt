BOOK 1.- Cum. Χ, ς ²5· 185

he has just ascribed to Thales, but only to the intimate nnion of mind
and matter in the same elementary substance; so that in the statement
of that view we must suppose an incorrectness of expression, perhaps
through tbe fault of Cicero, which has obscured its real purport.—
[The reading of this passage here given has become a sort of textus

receptus, and we bave not ventured to give any other, but it is far
from satisfactory. We have to deal of course not with what ‘l'hales
really taught, but with what Cicero thought he taught ; and the answer
is such as Cicero supposed an Epicurean would have made. In line 11
Cicero says that Thales taught that aquam esse initium rerum, and
that deum earn merrtem esse, which created all things out of water. He
must have thought then that deum and utentem were identical, denoting
the creating power as distinguished from aqua, the matter. Now the
Epicurean's objections to almost all the views commented upon in the
following summary is simply that we cannot conceive of God or mind ¹
without sensation, or without a body for this purpose: cf. l. 20, quasi aut
air sine ulla forma deus esse possit &c.; l. 31, aperta simplexque mens,
nullo re adiuncta, qua sentire possit, jugere intellegentiae nostrae vim et ν
notionem videtur,· 41, 33, air . . . quem sensum trabere potest aut quam 'f
firmam dei t So in 42, 2, in the criticism on Plato ; in 42, 29, on Aris·
totle; in43,14; in 43, 20. In the passage in question the objection is
made that God or mind must have a body and hence sensation3 and if
it could be otherwise, Thales had no need of associating god or mind with
water, he might have left it a separate existence. We understand then
the two suppositions Si di possunt esse sinerensu, andri ipsa mens con·
stare potest uacans corporeas the same in substance ; and the conclusion
to be drawn in the form of the question—mentem cur aquae adiunxit?
Heindorf proposed si dii possunt esse sine sensu cur aquae mentem ad·
iunxit, si ipsa mens &a Prof. Schoemann (Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 285) says
of this “Hoc resistant nilril opus est,” and emends the passage as it stands
in our text. But assuming as he does that the two suppositions arc dif-
ferent in substance, there should be two conclusions also diflering in sub·
stance. What difference is there between associating mind with water, or
water with mind? The logical train of thought under Schoemann's sup·
position would be: Sidi possunt dcc, muni (not mentem) cur aquae
adiunxit ,· si mens constare διο, mentem cur aquae adiunxit. It is of
course not possible to say what Cicero really wrote 3 but we should prefer
to read: Si di possunt esse sine seusu, mentem cur aquae adiunxit, si

ἵ ipsa mens dre. The eddand nso have sensu et mente cur aquaead·

iunxit,· and 13¹ (Orelli) has mentem for mente. A. Weidner (Philologus,

Ι Vol.38, 1879) emends thus: Sed nec di possunt esse sine sensu, et nien·
tem cur aquae adiunxit &c].
