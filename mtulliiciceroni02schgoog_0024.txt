INTRODUCTION. 11

Zeus,¹ and partly because these gods according to the Stoic explana·
tions were no persons, but things, relations, capacities, &0³3 hence
the Stoics have been attacked as being atheists. But these two

reproaches are easily seen to neutralize each other3 sor is these gods
were sor the Stoies only things, relations and capacities, and is they
were only called gods by way os personification, the Stoics could
not be blamed sor considering them mortal3 they could not os course
exist longer than the world. The other reproach could only reason·
ably be made by those persons who acquitted the Stoics os the
second (namely that the gods were only to be held as such vby a
figure os speech), while they recognized their belies in the person-
ality os the gods. And in 'reality it is difficult to see why the Stoice,
is not all, at least some or perhaps many os them might not have
held that belief. The consistency os the system certainly in no wise
sorbade their aclrnowledging the existence os superhuman beings
who, as servants and helpers os the supreme god, presided over the
world and human lise in various spheres and relations; and thus
they could always without hesitation assent to the popular saith
which offered them such deities. lt was a contradiction with the
popular saith 'that they conceived them to be morta1,bnt not one
worthy os blame. The popular saith was not shocked at the idea os
gods that had had abeginning; and is in spite os this it held such
gods as immortal, the Stoics were on the other hand more consis-
tent3 and the whole reproach, caresully examined, amounts to no
more than this, that, since immortality is necessarily included in the
idea os the deity, their gods, as not being immortal. were really no
gods, but only superhuman, demonic beiogs: buton the other
hand as a compensation sor this-they ¹conceived the one supreme
God os a majesty truly' divine.

A third reproach, which is osten made against the Stoics, is that
they degraded the gods by teaching that man owed to them only
inserior endowments and external goods, while he could attain to
wisdom and virtue by himself alone.⁸ This reproach too has no
¹sense except we concede that the gods were sor the Stoics real
