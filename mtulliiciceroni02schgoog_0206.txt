νοῦς, ascribing however the highest intellectnal and morai perfection¹ not

to this νοῦς, but to a later stage of development. Nothing more is known

of his views, and we cannot be certain whether qua omnia regnaturis
Α really said here in tlre sarne sense as he intended it.

extant. lt was one of the popular works written in the form of a dia·

42· 23. mundum ipsum doum esso. Aristotle nowhere asserts that
the universe is God: bnt he calls the heavens ἀθάνατόν τι troi θεῖον. De
Caelo 11, r, 3.

42. 23. alium quendam. He means probably what Aristotle in
Meteor. 1, 3 and De Caelo 11‚4 calls πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, πρῶτον τῶν σωμά-
των, an οὐσία σώματος ἄλλη πσρὰ τὰς ἐνταῦθα (ie. ἐν τῇ γῇ) συστάσεις θειο-
τέρα rol προτέρα (De Caelo Ι, 2), the quinta natura mentioned above
(note to c. 8, 19), which occupies the space above the moon, and from
which are formed the heavenly bodies and their spheres. This nobler,
godlilre clement is endowed with a circular motion, which explains the revo-
lution of the heavens and the heavenly bodies; auditis this motion which
is here designated by replicatio,a motion returning upon itself. Comp.
Stob. Ecl. Phys. 1, p. 64 and especially Plut. Plac. Phil. I, 7.

42. 25. caeli ardorem. Only another name for the substance just
spoken of, which Aristotle himself (De Caelo I, 3) explains to be what
others cali aether. On this expression see note to c. 8, 18.

42. 28. llll tot dl. By this expression it is impossible to understand
the three ·jnst mentioned, the arundus, the governor of the ntundas, and
the caeli ardor. Therefore sorne passage rnnst have been lost in which
heavenly bodies were probably spolren of ; and those, being formed of a
divine matter, might themselves be called divine (θεῖα, δαιμόνια). Comp.
Stob. Ecl. Phys. 1, p. 486, where they are also called teor. ’

42· 3²· semper· se movens. According to Aristotle the supreme
God is himself without motion, bulis himself the cause of the motion of
the universe. The Epicurean could not quite understand anything that
caused motion, being itself immovabie 3 hence he says se movens.

42. 33. Xenocrates of Chalcedon, disciple of Plato (hence condis· tt
capulus of Aristotle), and successor of Speusippus as teacher in the Acad-
emy after nc. 339.

42. 35. deos enlm octo esso dicit. The account of the theology of

Xenocrates is very incomplete; it is more fully given in Stob. Ecl. 1,
