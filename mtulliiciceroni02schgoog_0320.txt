where uses the peculiar expression chosen by Cotta, which really amounts
to only this‚nilril ert mundo melius ¹in mundo. This includes, itis true,
nulia pars'mnndi est munda metior: hut Cotta evidently uses it <with the
object of olisetting it with his own as a complete counterpart; namely, Ne
in terris quidem eerbe nostra, scil. quicquam metius est: although the rela-
tions ol the objects compared together in the two sentences, mamus to
rerum naturae, and urbs nostra to terrae, are essentially differens-’Ine
following argumentation, which agrees completely with that oi Alexinns
given by Sext. Emp. IX, 108, deserves the name oi calumnia which
Balbus applies to similar ones ΙΙ, 7, 20. It grossly misuses the word
metius, which of course rnay mean very different things as , applied to dit-
ierent objects and relations 3· and by taking it in some oi its relative signi·
fications and applying it to the universe one may succeed in throwing an
appearance of ridicule on the opinion ol the Stoics; but this vanishes as
soon as the word is taken in the sense which the Stoics intended. Comp.

no one would imagine that Zeno so turned the proposition. Nor can dita-
tavit be equivalent to effecit ret dilatari parsit. [We have kept the reading
dilatavit oi Mliller, which is also given by Baiter in hoth editions. , In a
note Mliller proposes the present, i.e. Iocus conclusione dilatatur. There
seems to be no valid objection against the perfect, the sense being that
Zenos way oi putting the argument has made it possible to extend its ap·
