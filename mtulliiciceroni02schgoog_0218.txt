49. 23. Philo nostor. Seec. 36. although it cannot be stated with
certainty, yetit is very probable that Cicero here attributes to Cotta what
was really true of himself. Also c. 28, 79 ; 33, 93.

49. 30. [bona vento-mo audias, excuse me for saying so, ie. for the
use of the epithets tam levis, tam ineptae]

49. 33. [ln physicis· Under this head the ancients brought the ques-uu
tion of the existence of the gods]

50· 5. Simonide, the famous lyric poet from Ceos, who, titre histt
somewhat younger contemporaries, Pindar, AEscbylus and his nephew .
Bacchylides, lived often and fos a long time at Syracuse at the court of
the elder Hiero. With what is said of him here comp. what Tertullian
Ad Nat. 11, 2, p. 183 Oehl. says of Thales: Thales Milesius Croeso scisci·
tanti, quidde deis arbitraretur, post aliquot deliberandi canonicatus nihil
renuntiavit. ,

“ 50· ιο. quid diost, quod . ..ossen Sit would have been more cor· ut
rect; but as the preceding dicitis used irregularly (though the assertione
of Epicurus may be considered as present and still subsisting in his
writings or in tradition), Cicero might properly use esset in the rela-
tive clause, just as if dixit had preceded in the principal one. Sinrilar
examples may be found above c. 15, 39 (fluerent atque manarent), ibid
40 (appellarent), 111, 28, 70 (uterentur); others may be found in Reisig,
Haase's note No. 5003 and Madvig, Cic. De Fin, p. 464.

50. 132 [dffllcllo eet nogara A proposition to be answered in the
next sentence-fn contione, ie. before a public assembly, on. grounds
of public policy; but there is no difficulty in denying the proposition in
huiusmodi sermone, in a familiar conversation among ourselves.] ’

5o.14. consessu. [Schoernann reads in consessu and says]s ,if the
proposition is allowed to stand here, we must assume that some word like

loc or tali has fallen out before consessu. ¹

50. 1 ς. ego lpse . . . lu. The repeated reference hythe demonstra·
tive pronoun serves to bring out the contrast more plainly. Comp. note to
¹ ΙΙΙ, 39, 93. [The pronoun is here repeats the subject ego, of the first
person; it refers in sense to pontifex and qui . . . arbitrar,· “as pontifex,
and as holding the opinion dre. (qni . . . arbitror), under these circurn-
stances (is) Ι should desire ” &c It is used with reference to the first or
second person only where it has the force of talis. Cic. Phil. II, 3ο, 76:
qui magister equiturn fuisse tibi viderere . . . is per municipia coloniasque
Galliae. . . curn Gallicis et lacerna cucurristi. The usage is to be distin·
