as the Stoic did one must remember that according to Chrysippus, from
whom this portion os the argument is doubtlcss directly or indirectly taken,
the thinking faculty resided in the breast‚ in the beart, and thus close to the
lungs. See Galen, De Hippocr. et Plat. Dogm. ΙΙ, 3 sq., and ΙΙΙ, 8. The
thought is formed here as Myos ἐνδιάθετος and comes forth as speechMyar
apopopardc, through the organa os speech-Tm Mss. have percipitur
instead olpercietnr [the reading in Schoemann's text].

127. 6. finita dentibus can hardly be right. Probably it should bc
munita dentibus. See Opasc. Ac. 111, p. 377.

127.6. vocem inmoderate profusam, the inarticulata sound; as on
the other hand moderatio vocis is used in De Leg. 1, 9, 27 lor the articula·
tion. By means oi the articulation are formed the different and definitely
determined sounds, soni vocis distincti et pressi, the characteristic endow·
ment ol the μέροπες ἅνθρωποι, by which they are distinguished from the
bcastsoi which the voxisimmaderate proflare. '

{33 127.13. molles commissuras et anus, “the movable‚ pliant con·
aections and joints ”3 ior which he might have said eamneissuras artuum.
Artus are really the same as articuli, Gr. tptpa,alth0ugh the word is alter·
wards used lor the members ol the body; mollis is originally equivalent to
mobilis, from which it is derived3 the meaning “soit'’ is only a sec·
ondary one.

111 127. 24 oondlta is here more probably from condere than from cen·
dire: The salting and especially the conserving‚ condire, ot' alimentary
substances is usual only to a limited extent; the laying aside however,
condere,is general; and the most important substances, the grains and
vegetables‚ need no conserving. Comp. too c. 62, 156 aad 63, 157.

1²7· 25. vasolmur . . . captando is an inexactness oi expression worth¹
noticing, sor quas capimus, alimus or quae capiuntur, aluntur.

127. 3¹· [terrum eligimue3 Mss. elicimus. So in 130. 26 sor reme·
dia eligamus the common reading is eliciamus. ln Tusc. 111, 5 83 stirpes
aegritudinis . . . eligendae sunt and in ΙΙΙ, ξ 84 fibrae stirpium . . ,eligendae
sunt the reading oi the Mss. eligendae is now accepted instead oi the com·
mon elidendae. In Div. 11, ς 149 where the common reading was super-
stitionis stirpes omnes eiciendae Madvig and Baiter adopt eligendae.
Miiller proposes to read elegimus aad eligamus in our text; the last is in

‘lact the reading oi Ms. A; the tormer has no Ms. authority]

¹27‘· 32. venas ponitus abditas. These words form the second
halt oi a trochalc tetrameter, and it is quite possible that not only here but
in De Offic. ΙΙ, 3, 13 Cicero had in mind a passage iram some poet. Still
the matre may have been oaly a matter ol chance. Comp. note c. 9, 253
