current in the mythology aad the traditional worship. ln their opinion
thore unseen beingr must be of higher reason and wisdorn than mankind ;
and hence having the duty and the power of taking part in the world as
servants of the supreme God according to his will and law, and of aiding
men, the nearest related beings, iu their imperfectiori and necessities, thus
eaming their gratitude and reverence. These are the beings intended,
when improvidentia deorum iaspolren of, as in 11, 29, 73; and the ex·
pression denotes the participatiou in the government of the world which
they exercire in conformity with the supreme will; hence it is unimportant
whether we say deorum or dei providentia. Christian theologiam, who
recognized the substantial agreement of this view with the biblical doctrine
of the angela, bave found fault with the Stoics for giving the name of gods
to those servants in the divine government; still, if one calls to mind the
original meaning of the word θεός or deur, he will find nothing to criticize.
lt would rather be desirable to set aside a special and distinctive name for
the supreme being, just as in fact zac is not seldom used, though having
really the same meaning as the other.

Nor can the Stoics be reproached for not withdrawing from the tradi·
tional polytheistic public worship. They did not wish to give their fellow
citizens unnecessary and useless offence; they did not neglect to oppose
and correct the superstitious and unreasoning views of the people, although
they were not very adroit or successful in it. 'l'ne curious etymologica and
generally forced allegorical explanations of the mythological fahles, exam·
ples of which we find in Balbus’s discourse arrd elsewhere, were evidently
not very well adapted to gain acceptance with the people.

Nor should we wonder that the Stoics, in spite of their opposition to
what was offensive in the mythological fahles, found it impossible quite to
avoid many ideas upon religious subjects which they found generally prev-
alent and in which they themselves had been brought up from childhood.
To this class belongs the belief in soothsaying‚ in visible apparitions and
exhibitions of power of divine beings, which Balbus appeals to and uses
even as proofs of the existence of the gods. Nevertheless the Stoics, as
time went on, divested themselves more and more of such remnants of an·
cient superstition, which in reality had no necessary connection with the
real essence and the moral teaching of their system ; and what Gellius XIX,
r, says of the doctrine of Epictetus cannot be denied, namely that it agreed

substantially with that of Zeno arrd Chrysippus„

ln Epictetus as well as in the ethica} writings of Antoninus, of Seneca
and others we find, besides the firm and living belief in one supreme God
of the universe, tire no less firm and living belief in those numerous super·

natural heings which they call sometimes gods, sometimes demons ; and
