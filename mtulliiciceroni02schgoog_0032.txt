hls philosophica! writings he was egregius multoque-quam in ora·
tt'om'bus praestantior ,· and further suffecit ponderi rerumr scios eum
sentire quae dr'cr't. Besides the books De Natura Deorum Cicero
dedicated to him De hirtius, the Tusculon Dumatrom, the Para·
dom and the Orator5 and called by his name the book De Clon's
Oratoribus, where Brutus is one oi the speakers.

The date ol writing this book may be determined, il not with
entire certainty, yet with the greatest probability. That lt was writ-
ten before the murder oi Caesar, that is before the Ides oi March,
710, follows without any doubt irom the manner ln which Caesar's
supremacy ls spoken oi in Ι, 4, 7; and that Cicero was occupied
upon it in the summer oi 709 may be inserted irom the letter¹ to
Atticus written in June oi this year (XIII, 39, 2), where he asks him
lor the book oi Phaedrus περὶ θεῶν doubtless to make use oi it in
the composition oi this book. - But the greater part oi Cicero’s ρΙιί·4
losophical works, the Academia, DoFim'ius, Tusculon Dr'sputations,
DeDivinntsonr, Dc Fato, De Senectute, Dc Officiis, Do Amicitia, and ⁹
the De Universo or Ilioneus, a translation of that oi Plato, among
those which are wholly or in part extant3 and the De Consolatione,
Hortensius, Dc Gloria, and perhaps De Virtutibus among those
which are lost with the exception ol a lew fragments, were written
ln the short interval between the spring oi 709 and the autumn oi
710, ln the sixtysecond and ditty-third years oi his liie; and while
we are astounded at n literary activity oi such extent, we learn,
partly from the prelaces to these treatlses and partly from the letters

to Atticus, the occasion ol writing them, and Cicero's state oi' mlnd
at the time. Hortata est, he says, N. D.. I, 4, 9, ut me od haic con·

child, to whom he was most tenderly devoted, and whose loss

afflicted hlm most deeply. He expresses his state oi mind in a
letter to Atticus (XII, 14, 3), written in March, 709: Nihil dr
