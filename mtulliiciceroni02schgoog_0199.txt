about 00 611. 110 held ¹the existence 01 0 primeval substance, ἁρχὴ,
which he ¹called dnecpov. It was undetined in quality and unlimited in
extent. There is a differeuce 01 opinion whether he considered the 11101000
10 be a mixture 01 011 the elementary substances which in time separated
apd assumed distinct existence, or an indefinite substance which poten·
tially contained aii the others. Aristotie, Phys. 111, 4, says lbat he
taught that the ἄπειρον was itseli divine, contained and govemed every·
thing. Itis probabis however that Anaximander did not express 1111110011
very clearly ou these points. He is said to have taught that the soul was
01 the natureoi air. See Ueberweg, Gesch. der Phil. 1, p. 36.]-na·

bodies are here meant, which, 00 we know, Anaxagoras held to be gods,
but other worlds like our own. , Comp. Stobaeus, Eciog. 1, p. 496; August.

lt 40. 18. Anaximenes, iikewise 01 Miletus arud 01 the Ionic school
. like Thales and Anaximander, whose disciple he is said to have been.-
allro. He held the doctrine 01 an elementary substance like the air,
which he considered, as Thales did water and Anaximander the dnetpov,

not as mere 11101000 11101101, but as endowed with living 10100. Stobaeus, ,
I, p. 56 says also that he called it god. -eumque gigni. The statement
that Anaximenes held the airy elementary substance 10 bave been created,
not to have existed irom eternity, is doubtless an error, difficuit to under·
stand or excuse. ex eoque onznia gigni would be a more correct statement
(Stobaeus, p. 296) ; but that is not to be thought 01 here.

Cicero and others are right in calling him a disciple oi the preceding.

40. 23. primus . . . voluit. Anaxagoras passes 101 the tirst philoso-
pher who rose to the idea 01 a pure, immateriai spirit. It is certain that
he held the existence oi a νοῦς, which as a thinking, moving and regulating
principle be opposed to the original matter that contained in 110011 all the
constituente 01 the physicel world, the so·called ὁμοιομερῆ, and believed
the two to be essentiaily different. He called the νοῦς λεπτότατον πάντων
χρημάτων xol nodnpdrnrov; expressions which may be due 10 the want oia
more appropriate designation 101 what is purely immaterial (ἀσώματον, 000
