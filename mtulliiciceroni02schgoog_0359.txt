that by these ablatives he only intended to characterize the simultaneous
occurrence of both these praeesses, i.e. the entrance of the air and the
expansion of the lunga, without thinking of the actual relation of the two
which we designate as a conditional or a causal one; the lung does not
expandis or because the air enters, but the contrary, is or since the lung
expands the air enters, as iu a pair of bellows, with which indeed the
breathing process is for this reason compared, eg. by Aristotle De Resp. c.
21. Now it is quite possible that the matter was not quite clear to Cicero,
or that he thought it unnecessary to describe it more definitely, which it
would have been quite easy to do by writing, say trahentes spiritum. But
as little as 1 should be inclined to grant this, no more can I regard Mad·
vig's conjecture as free from objection. Moreover if the original text had
read thus, such an easily understood expression would hardly have become ¹
so corrupted as the variations found in the Mss. show. But if the original
text read iu respiratis, the change to respiritu with or without in is ex·
plicable from the difficulty the correctore found in respiratus, just as for
example in Cic. Attio. 1, ep.18,3 and Liv. XXX, 15, 3 the Mss. waver
between suspiratur and suspiritus. Orelli omitted iu before respiratus ,⁶
as it has sufficient warrant in tbe Mss. I have thought best to leave it, ·
and so have not quite followed Lambinus.

Il,59, 147. [et] qualis sit (Schoemann for qualisque sit). As the
copula is wanting in the Mss. it is not improbable that the words are nothing
but a gloss to quam vim habeat. Hence Baiter has bracketed them, as
also the preceding idque ratione, on the genuineness of which no one save
the most recent translator will believe.

11, 66, 165. Sin autem his consulunt. Bouhier with some reason sup·
poses tbat Cicero wrote si autem. At least sin would not be used here in
the usual way, namely as introducing an assumption that contradicts or ex·
tends one that precedes, whether expressed or implied (see Opusc. Ac. Ill,

p. 372, note 2). It is clear that neither of these is the case bere, but only
a further consequence is drawn froin what precedes.
