1111111111. 333

’ 1, 37, 103. The reading 01 the Mss.,saperior aetheri, ignibus altissima*
ora reddatur, retained by Baiter, seems to rne plainly erroneous‚ and seems

to have arisen from some one’s explaining ignibus, which here as in c. 15,

39 (see note) ¹means the aether, by aetheri, and by this note creeping into

the text und taking the place 01 the proper reading oiri. Ι1 aetheris

sometimes used 101 air (see Munro on Lucretius ll, 1115), such a use

would be incredible here, where 1111 1111111111 opposed to the ignibus and

situated below 1111111 11 iu question.'

l, 37, 105. It seems proper 11111 10 discuss the passage ο1 Diog. L. X,
139 which, as it is preserved in 1111 Mas.. partly coincides with what Cotta
here and Velleius in c. 19, 49 give as the doctrine 01 Epicurus, but partly
differs so much, that some have 1111 obliged to 111111 that Epicurus held a

. doctrine about the gods which is mentioned neither by Cicero nor by any·

oue else, while others hold the passage as corrupt and any restoration (111-
iicult or impossible. The passage runs thus in the Mssa ἐν ἄλλοις di φησιν
(ale. Ἐπίκουρος) τοὺς θεοὺς λόγῳ θεωρητοὺς, οὓς μὲν κατ’ ἅριθμὸν ὑφεστῶτας,
111ςό111111 1711111111νὲ1 τῆς συνεχοῦς insidiosos τῶν ὁμοίων ettam ini τὸ
oiri ἅποτετελεσμένων ἁνθρώπυειδὼς. 11 the reading be correct, it is 11111
that two classes 01 gods are here distinguished ; and hence several writers,
Tennemann (Gesch. d. Phil. 111, p. 416 1.), Heindorf (on Cic. D. N. I, 19,
50), Steinhart (article on Epicurus in the alligem. Encyklop. d. Wissensch.
11. 11111111, I, 35, p. 477, note 64), Hegel (Vorles. u. d. Gesch. d. Philos.
published by Michelet, Werlre Tb. XIV, p. 507), have accepted such a dis·
tinction and attempted to explain it in their own way. In my essay De
Epicuri Tbeologia, p. 352 11. l have set forth the arguments against this 111
1111111. 1 think 1 have shown that the distinction is quite inadmissible, and
thatin the passage 01 Diogenes the 0117111 . . . οὓς δέ must be necessarily
regarded as corrupt. Gassendi and Meiners have already expressed the '
111111 opinion. The former proposed mi μέν, ὡς δέ, the latter (Verm. Phi·
los. Schr. 11, p. 121) ori μέν . . , ἀλλά. My own is perhaps a more proba·
ble emendation: ori μὲν κατ’ ἀριθμὸν ὑφεστῶτας [γνωστ]οὺς δὲ κατὰ ὁμοει-
1111111811. Α1111 >consciae was mutilated as lhave indicated, and the remain-
ing οὺς taken 101 οὓς, nothing was easier than to change the preceding mi
μέν into οὓς μὲν, so that οὓς di could be referred to it. The passage thus
corrected agrees pert'ectly with what we know from other sources. The
κατ’ ἀριθμόν corresponds 10 adnumerum: the gods cannot be counted, not
individually distinguished by us3 but they are still perceivable in conse·
quence 01 the similar nature 01 the impressions continually coming 10 us
l'rom them. lt is clear that ἕπιρῤὑσεως and transitione mean the same

. thing, but it will hardly occur to any one to take thern as meaning only
