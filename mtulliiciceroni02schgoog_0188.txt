cessor of the Academic scepticism and the opposition to the dogmatista
of the other schools because of his assertione That he lsnew only one
thing, namely, that he knew nothing; and because of the reasoning he
used to convict of ignorance those who boasted of knowing something.
-Aroosllae' of Pitane in AEolis ac. 316—241 went further than Socrates;
for as Cicero says, Acad. Ι, 12, 45, negabat esse quidquam quod seiri posset,
ne illud quidem ipsum, quod Socrates sibi reliquisset ,· sic omnia tatere in
occulto. —On Carneades see c. 2, 4.

that in the absence of a sure criterlon a certain and definite knowledge of
the truth was nnattainable and that one must rest satisfied with probability.

drawn the conclusion ” &a ln the following clause the words multa esee
probabllfa evidently mean that there are many things probable and yet
not certain, which still may furnish to a reasonable man sufficient guides
for his practical actions—Visum, accus. from the verbal subst. visus,
