unum egregii mortalem aliique silenti ,· Epod. x11,4= sagacius unser
odoror. ln the tert the Mss. carelessly have unum before convenii, where
it gives no adequate sense.

102. 2. oonstltutas, “set in order ”3 ior the Stoic did not, any more
than other ancient philosophers‚ believe in an actual creation oi the world
hythe gods, that is, a creation out oi nothing. Comp. note c. 35, 88. ln
the passage iarther on: ab animantibus principiis ea esse generem, it is
only intended to say, that the existing divine lactors in the creation ol the
world, themselves issued from the elementa} ether, the λόγοι σπερματικοί
(Plut. De Plac. Phil. 1, 7, 17, Diog. L. VII, 148), or the δυνάμεις γόνιμοι
(as M. Aurel. IX, 1 extr. calls thern) which are spirit and matter in one,
have caused later created things to issue from themselves. lt must how·
ever be consessed that this proposition does not really belong here, where
the discourse was to be, not oi the origin ol things, but oi the govemment
os the world. Ι

102. 8. aa mangenarum. 'lhe Mss. have eam . . generatam, which
would refer to sentiens natura. But by this last expression we oan only
understand, as the subsequent explanation ξς 81-86 shows'the soul of the
universe, i.e. the portion os the original deity entering into the universe
(see Introd, p. 8), which first manifests itsell in the λόγοις σπερματικοῑς,
Cicero’s aninranribus principiis, but is by no means created by them.

102. 12. simulacra. ..imagines The change os expression does
not denote a difference in the views oi these philosophers‚ but the two
words are synonyme employed lor the sake ol variety. Comp. l, 12, 29
where the gods os Democritus are also called imagines: and 1, 26, 74.
Itis quite true however that the ridolto ol Democritus differ stom those ol
Epicurus in this, that the latter proceed from the divine beings existing in
the intermundia ,· the former arise from the atoms flowing forth from the
iormless divine substance (see note on l,43,120),which take various t'orrns
by their own agency. Comp. Papeneordt De Atomic. Doctr. (Berolin.
1832), p. 703 and Schoemann's essay De Epicuri Theolog. in his Opusc.
Ac· 1v, P· 353·

102. 12. quodam paeto negat. This is true in a greater degree oi
Epicurus, whose so·called gods were hardly worthy the name, than os ¹
Democritus, whose gods were not entirely without influence on the affairs
oi men. See above 1, 43, 120.

roa. 18. vl magna incitata. Α necessity assumed to be original,
and yet set in action hy any other force, would be a contradiction. vi
inagna then is not to he translated “by a powersul sorce,” but “ wien pow-
erlul sorce,” [abl. modi] ; and incitata is to be taken iu a medial, not a
passive sense [⁴‘acting powerlully '’].
