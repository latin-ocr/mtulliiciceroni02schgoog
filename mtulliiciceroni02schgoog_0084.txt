COTTA having finished the refutatiou of the Epicurean theology‚
Balbus begins his exposition of the Stoic doctrine. He divides

four parts: 1. proof of the existence of the gods; 2. explanation
of 'their nature and of their various sorts3 3.··pr00f that the world

of the gods through divination and auspices (4-12). Next follows
a statement of the reasons assigned by Cleanthes for this universal
belief in the godsy' first, the revelations of future events; second,
