θρεπτική only, beasts witha ψυχὴ oiotinrtri besides, men with ι λογικοὶ
also. Comp. Arist. De. An. 11, 35 Macrob. In Somn. Scip. 1, 14, 73 and
19223· '

lt 88.34 Quartus autem gradus. It is evidcnt that while the first
three grades are known by expericnce‚ the fourth is only assumed to com·
plete the series, which otherwise would not include the most perfect beings,
as is seen from ς 35.

88. 35. natura bont sapientesque. Comp. Senec. Epist. 95: di irn-
mortales nullam didicere virtutem, eum omni editi, et pars naturae eorum
estesse bonos. Φύσει κοθοροὶ καὶ ἁκὴροτοι in Epict. IV, ιι, 3. Deorum
virtus natura excellit, hominum autem industria, Cic. Top. c. 20, 76.

89.1. ratio recta constansque; reason that always hits the mark,
true to iucif, never falling into contradiction with itseli: λόγος ὀρθὸς rol
ὁμολογούμενος καὶ βέβαιος καὶ ὰμετόπτοτος (Plut. De Virt. Mor. c. 3); to
think and act in conformity with this is wisdom and virtue.

The recta rouo is supra hominem putanda only in so lar as regards
an inborn reason, not one that is gradually developed and brought to per·
fection. For although man very seldom really reaches it, it is not to be
thought utterly impossible; homo enim sopiens steri potest he says below
5 36. But comp. De Offic. Ill, 4, πός De Amic. c. 5, 18.

ω 89. 4. in ulla rerum institutione, in the case of any organized sys-
tem oi things3 ol any things which are arranged by nature or by man.

89. 9. ln omnl natura, i.e. in universa natura or rerum omnium
notura, hence in mundo. On rerum omnium natura, which is here at
least as fitting as r. omnis n. comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 362. [ac
connects sic and nerito magis ,· “in the same manner and in much higher
degree.”]

tto 89. 25. deterior potius. potius is byrro means superfluous, merely
strengthening deterior. On the contrary it alone really serves ior the com·
parison ol the two members ; the assertion is that the predicate deterior
would be applicable to the condition oi the mundus rather than to that oi
man. The comparison to which the comparative deterior points is not
iully developed in the sentence, became it is easily understood without
that; we rney supplement thus, deterior dc duabus.

rr 89. 31. undique optuma “ on all sides, ie. in all respects suitably
arranged.” -omnlbus suls numeris et partibus. The second expres·
sion might have been omitted; ior numeri often denotes all the essential
parts oi a thing, conformably to the Greek usage ; as in Diog. L.V11, roo:
τὸ τέλειον ἀγαθὸν παρὰ τὸ πάντας ἀπέχειν τοὺς ἐπιζητουμένους ἀριθμοὺς ὑπὸ
τῆς φύσεως.
