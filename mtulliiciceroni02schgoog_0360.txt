111, 3, 8. et non altero coniveant for the Mss. contuear is aa emenda·
tion accepted also by Baiter after Madvig’s confident recommendation. so
in c. 4, 9 cur coniveres for corrtueres found ln the best Mss, which others
have changed into contuerere. Thevariations in Plinius, eg. X, 75, 97,
p. 215 Sillig, besides the examples cited by M, show how commonly the

copyists confused these two verbs.

ΙΙΙ, 9, 23. Saepe dixti nihilfieri sine deo nec ullam vim esse naturae, ⁷

arsat dissimilia posset iffingere. The statement nihil sieri sine deo no·
'where occurs, at least in this form, in the dlscourse of Balbus; and even
supposing that here, where the Stolo doctrine of the divinity of the world
’ is criticized, sine deo were equivalent to sine mundo, there can have been
uo probable reason why Cotta should not choose the expression which was
evidently more fitting and liable to no mistalre. One Ms, certainly not of
‚ the best, which Creuzer denotes by La, has sine mundo: but, as arundus has
been mentioned just before, sine eo might appear sufficient and more prob·
able,as it did to Creuzer. But even thus the expression does not seem
definite and clear enough to designate what is here required. fieri sine
aliquo may be'sald of everything which takes place without the coiipera·
tion of any one; hut here, where the question is plainly of the origin of
things, where the mundus is to be conceived as not only coiiperating but
as creating and producing, some other expression seems to be required.
Heindorf saw this plainly and for sine eo conjectured nisi ex eo, just as we
lind shortly after ex eo procreantem· comp. ΙΙ, 35, 88: mundus ex quo ori·
untur et fiunt omnia. -In the next sentence nec reliam vim esse naturae,
ert sui dissimilia posset effingere we must evidently understand by reaturo
only nature in general (natura mundi ΙΙ, 22, 58, ri roi> abrenuntiaret.
Vll, 75), ie. the creative power of the universe, but not any natural ex·
istence in particular. Hence Wallrer rightly saw that we should read iliam
for uttam. lt is further to be noticed that the expression sui dissimilia,
which Cotta employs, does not quite correspond to the sense of what Bal·
bus had said, for Balbus had not and could not say that the all-creating
natura could create nothing uniike itself, but only that it could create
nothing better and more perfect than itself ; ΙΙ, 33, 86: ea quae efferant

aliquid ex sese perfectiores habere naturas quam eo quae ex iis efferantur,-
comp. II, 8, 21.

ΙΙΙ, 14, 36. intrinsecus is the reading, undoubtedly correct, ol Bouhier
instead of the opposite extrinsecus,‚which is here impossible; formerly 1
adopted et sentiens, proposed by Wyttenbach in its place. Although there
may be no other example of intrinsecus animal, the explanation given in
Ι the notes is not to be doubted. ’
