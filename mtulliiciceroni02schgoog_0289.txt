represented a Greek, the poet certainly erred in making the speaker refer
to the Romans as nostri, and so to the Greeks as strangers. The criticism
of Cicero is just. The following words Astatiae loquiturcontain an ob·
jection to this criticism‚ which is however immediately answered. This
objection, says Cicero, would only hold if we were not obliged really to
imagine the speaker as a Greek, but the poet himself in the following
verse of the same piece shows us expressly that we must do so.-Evi·
dently the whole digression is introduced to give an appearance of the ’
greater ease of friendly conversation, as also in 111, to, 25.

account the possible alternative that the earth might also grow cold if the
sun were to move away from it.

st 108. 1. quam monseunaco! vocant. Cicero adds this remark
because the Greek word was quit'e familiar to his readers, but the Latin
word was first coined by himself, as he says Acad. I, 6, 24, where he reck·
ons it among the verbis inauditis. The Greek ποιότης too was first coined
by Plato, as is remarked in his life in Westermann's Biogr, p. 393, as well
as in other places. The word occurs in Theaet, p. 182 A, where Plato him·
self calls it an ἁλλόκοτον ὄνομα.

above c. 30, 75. As Balbushas in fact been treating of this part of the
argument since c. 36, he calls attention to it as it were in a supplementary
way. This is not to be regarded as an error of Cicero, but is a part of
the imitation of extempore discourse, which very well admits of the liuius
&mutare (see note c. 7, ao).
