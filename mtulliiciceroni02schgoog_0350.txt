they seem to maire no diilerence between these two, unless it be that the
second denotes especially the beings nearest to man; just as man's reason·
able soul is otren'catted the demon that duells in him. This whole class
ol subordinate beings appears in general to be employed in the service ol
the supreme being, filled with the divine logos, and hence friendly dis·
posed to men; men have a ditntner and less vivld consciousness ol the
divine Logos, which needs qutckening and strengthening3 and in this they
are aided by these inferior beings, who act as mediators between them and
the highest (iod, with whom direct communication seems to be hardly con·
ceivable. ln this sense Antoninus IX, 40 recommends men to pray to the
gods ior moral light and strength; Zeus, that is the supreme being, says
Epictetus, Dias. I, 14, 12, has given to every man his demon to watch over
him. Man, says he (ΙΙΙ, 24, 60), must strive to be on friendly terma with
the gods, he must be mindlul that he is related to them (l, 9, tt and 23),
and hence must try to be like thern. These teachings are really only another
iorm oi expression lor the highest moral law ὁμολογουμένως τῇ φῦσε-ι Criu:
lor it is the higher nature ol man that is here in question, which manifesta
itsell as the divine Logos in the reason and conscience, and constitutes his
relationshlp with the gods. Τψ λογικῷ (dp ἡ αὑτὴ πρᾶξις κατὰ φυσιν ἐστὶ καὶ
κατὰ λόγον. Antonin. Vll, 11.

character, though not a theological one, the theological portion is limited
to a very lew simple propositions, which would rather recommend than
injure them in the eyes ol many. Not to enter more sully into the subject Ι
a single point may be mentioned, which has been noticed by Simplicius ln
his commentary to Epictetus, Enchiu, p. 8. He saysz καὶ τοῦτο δ’ ἄν τις
τῶν λόγωντοθτυν θαυμάσειεν, ὅτι τοὺς πειθομένους καὶ ἐργαζομένοις τὰ λεγό-
μενα μακαρίους ἀποτελοῦσι ιιαὶ εὐδαίμονας, οὐθὲν δεηθέντες τὰς μετὰ θάνατον
τῆς ἀρετῆς ἀμοιβὰς ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι, κᾶν πάντως ἀκολουθῶσιν καὶ alnae. And
so it really is; Epictetus never refers to a reward to be expected aiter
death. Although the Stoics never deuied the continuing existence oi the
soul alter death, many ol them having expressly prolessed their heliel in it,

yet they never presumed to spealr ol a future judgment, oi punishment ol
the wicked and oi rewards lor the righteous. Ol course they thus surren-

dered a motive ior well doing, which may be the most powerlul ior the

majority ol people, and which lor this reason cannot be abandoned ina
catechetical instruction intended lor the multitude.
