nature ol the gods. The doctrine ol atoms, as being the original
elements oi all things, is silly and untenable; but even granting it
to be true. and so supposing the gods to have arisen lrom atoms,
their immortality would be in contradiction with it (65-68). But
in order to be able to maintain this immortality Epicurus takes his
usual course when he wishes to escape the consequences os his own
principles3 he flies to other arbitrary and inconceivable propositions.
The gods, says he, are not corporea, but only quasi corporea!
beings.¹ But this quasi corporeality is a word devoid oi sense, con-
veying no idea even to Epicurus and his disciples (69-75). But let
this pass, if we will. the case is no better for the assertion that the
gods have human forms. The reasons given by the Epicureans in
support ol this are next reiuted one after another3 and especially
the assertion, that no person can imagine the gods* under any other
form, is rejected as practically salse, since many represent them
under the figures os beasts (76-82). But it is quite unworthy oi a
philosopher to appeal to representations oi that sort. A person
might with equal justice also maintain that the gods really bear the ⁵
names that are traditionally used to denote them3 and the ioolish·
ness oi this is directly apparent, when we obseive that the sanie
gods are differently called among different nations.²

li now we may not attribute to the gods either the human form,
as we have proved, nor in deserence to Epicurus any other· form, it
would not be venturing too much to deny their existence entirely;
yet the Epicureans do not venture this ior sear not only of men but
also oi the gods themselves (83-86). But ir the assertion is made
that reason can exist only in union with the human form, because
² we have no experience oi it in any other shape, we may answer that it
is quite unphilosophical to maintain that a thing oi which we have
no experience may not lor all that have existence (87, 88).

1 When Cotta states that Epicurus assumes this finer bodily substance, the
quari corpur oi the gods, only lor the purpose oi explaining their immortality,
it is certainly either misunderstanding or intentional misrepresentation. 'Ihe
· immortality could only be explained according to Epicurus by the law ol
isonomy; at the same time he might add that the finer corporeal substance ol
the gods was iu itsell less liabte to dissolution and corruption than the coarser
bodies oi other things- For another misrepresentation‚ that Epicurus explained
the immortality irom the infinite multitude oi atoma see note to c. 39, 109.

iThe answer Epicurus might have made is not difficult to discern; comp.
