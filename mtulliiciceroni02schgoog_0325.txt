147. 19. ad eundem ettam interitum ventre. In the ioregoing
member Cicero used the subjunctive after neeesse est: it is easy to see why
he now changes to the infinitive. This might be taken to depend on the
toregoing eaden ds'cs' possum but not so we113 and the change oi con·
struction occurs in other passages. Comp. Acad 11,12,392 ante videri

draws its nourishment from the great sea. For the great sen separates our
οἰκουμένη from the opposite southern one (see note to II, 66, 164), and lies
itseis in the hot zone between the two bopics, one os which, the Tropic οἰ
Cancer, Cicero here calis the solstitialis orbis, the other, the Tropic of
Capricorn, brumalis—It has been noticed that the words our ee . ι dm)-
