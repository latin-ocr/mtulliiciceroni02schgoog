ὀξ 99. 5. inter 'mare ei caelum. The Stoic prefers to say “between
sea and sky,” i.e. aether, rather than “between earth and sky,” because he
thereby at the same time intimates the intermediate nature ο1 the air be·

. tween water and ether. Comp. c. 39, ¹0¹3 45, ¹¹73 Ps. Aristot. De Mund.

99. 9. a iuvando. The derivationis hardly admissible. The nemeis
rather 119111 the same root as Iovis, and to he compared with the Greek
Διώνη.

99.10. ex fabulls3 according to the mythological lables, 191 which
it may suffice to reier 19 Hom. Il. XV, 187 ff.

99. ¹3· Neptunus. The comparison ο1 this etymology with that 91
Portunus is curious enough. lt is quite possible 11111 the nemeis related
1ο nore, but we must think on the signification 91 stuung, which the verb
has lost in Latin, but which the Greek νάω and νέω retain. The forms vobo
(191 odo), the Fut. υεὺσομαι 91 νευσοῦμαι, and ναῦς, navis, testiiy to the
digamma in these words. So then Nevituuus, Nevtuuur, Neptunus would
nothe improbable, and lhe name would be 91 the same root as the Greek
Νηρεὺς. Others compare it with the Sanscrit Naupotr, the name given in
the Rigveda 1ο the god 91 the overhanging cloud-heavens.

99.14. Dltl. The identification with Πλούτων is easily and osten
made ς whether correctly so is a question. < ’

was introduced the more easily because in this form it reminded one 91 ’
proserpere, and seemed 19 point to the springing up 91 plants. The ex·

which have fallen out in the best Mss. stand in some 11111 nomeu est.

11 99. 19. ogorondtsrruglbuscoros. So Varro says too, L. L, V,64‚
but wrongly. The name seems rather to be related with Cerus manus,
cited 119111 the‘Carmina Saliaria, and explained 1ο mean creator bouus, from
the root cer, 119111 which creo also comes. Comp. Corssen, Krit. Beitr. z.
Rlim. Lautlehre, p. 342.—That Δημήιηρ was the same as Γῆ Μήτηρ is an
error that prevailed among the learned Greeks, and has been obstinately
held hy some moderns. Comp. Ahrens Dial. Dor, p. 80, and Klihner,
Greek Gr. ι’, p. 122 (Germ. ed). It is equivalent to Δέα μήτηρ, goddess
mother. ula is cited by Hesychius as the Tyrrhenian name 91 Rhea, like
the equivalent deo. This 191111 also occurred in the Doric dialect3 see
