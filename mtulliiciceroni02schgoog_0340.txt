160. 19. lege Plaetoria, ior the protection oi minors (under twenty·
five years) against lrsud in legal matters. The lew allowed a eriminal
action in such cases, and this might be brought not only by the injured

would bitterly repent having offered the prayer. Cf. De Offic. Ι, 10, 327
ΙΙΙ, 25, 94, where this example is used to show that it is sometimes better
to break than to keep one‘s word. The well-known table ol Phaethon is
