them, is still not without value for the history of philosophy, be
cause no fuller compilation of this sort has come down ιο us fr'om
antiquity.-After a cursory glauce at the myths of the poets and
the fantastic notions of some foreign nations (42, 43) there follows
the exposition of the doctrine of Epicurus, as being the first satis·
factory solution after so many fruitless attempta.

Epicurus starts from the ‘riatural and universal consciousness of
god as the only su ie and irrefragable proof of the existence of the
gods. This very consciousness too testifies to their happiness and
Α immortality3 from which it further follows, that they neither are
occupied about anythingpor interfere at all with other beings3 they

. are disturbedm by no affections s'i'rch as loire or hate, aiid so because

of the sublimity and excellence of their nature they may be objects
of reverence, but never of fear (44, 45). ln re'gard ιο their form
and other matters the data of natural consciousness taken with rea·
sonable inferences lead to the following conclusions: first, that the
gods have-human forms, because nobody has ever conceived them
under any other, none other is more beautiful and more worthy of
the gods, and none other is ever found united with reason (46, 47) ι
second, that they have not a coarse material body like an earthly
one, cognizable by the senses, but that their bodies consist of an
infinitely finer substance which is only quasi body and quasi blood,
perceptible not by the senses but by the mind, which is continually
and directly affected by impressions (foragines) which flow forth from
the gods (48, 49). Upon further reflection, ιο which they prompt the
. human mind, we anive at the conception of the gods as happy and
immortal beings, in conformity with the law of lsonomy or of equal
proportion¹3 this law forces us to the conclusion that, as there exists
’ an infinite number of destroying forces, there must also bean infi-

¹'Ihiu law of lsonomy we find mentioned only in Cicero; other writers say
nothing of ιι even when occasion seemed to require it, as, eg, Sext. Emp. adv.
Math. IX, 4⁶. lt reminds one of the law of equilibrium of the clemens, spoken
of by Origen, ctr. Cels. lV, 63: τὸ ἰσοστάσιον τῶν στοιχειων ἀπὸ τῆς προνοίας
γίνεται σῦκ’ ἐπιτρεπούσης πλεονεκτεῖν τὸ ἓν, ινα μὴ ὁ κόσμος φθαρῇ. ι Comp.
