of informatiun justifies us in supposing that Cicero's Velleius iras in error
onthis poinhand that he ascribed to Epicurus mmmhing that came, not
from him, but from some later follower of his; aud which iras rejected by
the others, because they saw that the law itself needed fust to be proved
and that this could hardly be done in the Epicurean system of physiology.
lt was therefore allowed to drop ; and thrrs we may explain the absence of
any mention ol it even where it would seem to be necessary. Wbo the
Epicurean was who advanced it canum of course be ascertained Only
thus much is clear that Cicero did not use the saum source in this part of
his bools for c. 16-21 as for c. 8-16; and Chr. Petersen (Phaedr. fr. π.
tteue, p. 45) has advanced the theory that for c. 16-21 he used a book of
the Epicurean Zeno ; and be finds a confirmation of th'u in ξ 59. 'lhis is
certainly not impossible ; but more cannot be said. lt the theory ot

l'etersen is correct, it would also follow that Cotta’s refutation of Velleius ⁵
in the second part of this boolr, which in §109 treats especially of the Ison-
omy, was taken, nottlrom Clitomachus, whom Cicero certainly used iu the
third boolr, but from some later Academic who had written against the
Epicurean author whom Velleius has followed in c. 16-21. Further con·

jectures are rueless.

a false reading; the emendation of Lachmann (note on Lucret, p. 351),
rt'c incitetur, correspopds somewhat better to the traditional reading so
faras the written characters are concerned than sic afficiatur, the read-
lng proposed in the note; but ir does not meet the requirements of the

sense, as is shown in the note. Comp. also Opusc. Ac. Ill, p. 284 and 303.

l, ιο, 25. 'l'he words, mentem, menti autem cur aquam are wanting
ln the Mss. lt is hardly necessary to answer at length the opinion of the
most recent translator, that itis enough to write motu lor mente without
attempting to supplement tbe text at all. Comp. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 285.
llalter, recognizing the break, writes: se' di possunt esse sine sensu et mente,
mentem eur aquae adiunxit? menti autem cur aquam adiunxit, sr' apsa
mens const. pot. vac. corp. ,· thus substantially agreeing with the emended
text. hlarlvig prefers to erase the words si di possunt erse sine sensu et
mente in this sentence, and to insert them as a parenthesis in the next

sentence regarding Anaximander, after nativos esse deos.
