justification os the belief in the gods, thus concisely stated: as
it is certain that the universe and its everlasting order' have not
been produced by human power and human wisdom, so is it equally
certain that the being which did produce them is higher than man..
But beings higher than man must be gods; we can conceive noth·
ing else higher than man, because man alone is endowed with rea-
son, and reason is the highest possible endowment. ls then there
exists anything higher than men (and to deny it would be the most
ioolish presumption), it follows that there must be gods (16). This
¹argument, which, as may be seen, takes sor granted the idea oi the
gods as superhuman intelligent beings and is only directed to show ,
that such beings must of necessity exist, is then somewhat further
, developed. It would be ioolish to think that the universe was in-
tended to be an abode tormen alone and not sor higher' beings as
well—Human reason itself, limited and incomplete as it is, pre-
supposes the existence oia more complete ,and hence a divine
reason from which it is derived. Just as everything which pertains
to the bodily organization oi man is derived t'rom elements existing
in the world, so must the best· in man, the thinking spirit, be de-
rived from a thinking being existing in the world, and it would be
absnrd were we to ascribe to the universe everything·except the
highest and best (17, 18). F inally, the wise order os the world,
the connection and interponebation oi all its parts lead necessarily
to the recognition oi a divine spirit governing and holding together
the whole (19). Some short propositions os Zeno follow summing
up in syllogistic forms the essentials of the foregoing argument
(ao-22). Next comes a detailed deduction t'rorn the speculative
physics oi the Stoics, the preceding proofs having all‘been drawn
from the point oi view oi the ordinary human reason. [All vegetable
and animal lite in the universe depends upon heat3 sor individua}
motion and activity can only dwell in what is endowed with heat3
lite is only a definite, unisorm mode olactivity, which proceeds from
the principle oi heat existing in all living bodies, and this principle
is thus seen to pervade the whole universe (23, 24). This general
prevalence is further evident from the fact that we find beat in all

oned dreams and revelations3 second, ἀπὸ τῶν μετεώρων, irorn the contempla-
tion oi the heavens and the heavenIy phenomena. See Sext. Emprr. adv.
