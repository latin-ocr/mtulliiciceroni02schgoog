consider as tbe πέμπτη οὐσία, quinta natura or quinto essentia (Macrob.
in Somn. Scip. l, 14, 2ο) the aether, ie. the fine etheris substance oi
which according to Aristotle the heavenly bodies consisted, which sur·
rounded and penetrated tbe universe and formed according to many the
substance ol the soul. According to Plato however, who takes the aldio
only ior the higher, finer air (p. 58 D), tbe soul eomes neither from this
nor lrom any mixture or combinatiou ο1 the live iorms oi matter (comp.
Trendelenburg’s note to Arist. De Anim. I, 2, 7, p. 228) ; and all that the
earlier commentatore have advanced to explain the traditioual reading iu
the text, ad axionum efficiendum, is quite untenable. The correct reading
is afficiendum. For Plato explains in d'etail, p. 64 A to 68 C, how the dit·
serent modifications and mixtures ο1 the elements are adopted to atlect tbe
organs oi sense aud by means ο1 these tbe soul (τὸ φρόνιμον, p. 64 B) and
to produce sensio, ie. perceptions.—Sensus, not censer but perceptions, ’

quadam impulsione oblata extrinsecus-pariendos sensus, like dolo·

“wortby ol tbe palm,” i.e. the prize ol victory; ironically oi course. But it
is very doubtful whether Cicero really wrote thus, supplying mentally
sententia'irom ξ 18, ol res (as Zumpt thinks, ad Verrin, p. 297 and
p. 700). Perhaps be wrote: sed illud palmare esi, or illa palmaria as
Baiter and Madvig preler3 lor although Plato’s assertion is a single one,
yet it migbt have been made several times and in several sentences
(p. 32 C, 33 A, 41 A) and so be indicated by a plural.
