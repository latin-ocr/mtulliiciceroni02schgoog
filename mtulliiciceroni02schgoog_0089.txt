or providence, as being the intelligent force everywhere aiming at
adaptation, permanence and beauty (57, 58).

Besides the gods whose existence has thus far been proved,
namely the universe and the heavenly bodies, wise men, continues
Balbus, have lor good reasons accepted many others. Deslrable and
uselul things have been regarded as gilts of divine persons and so
have been named after the givers3 as, ior instance, wine and grain
are called Liber and Ceres: so also virtues and relations of great
importance, which were referred to especial divine influence, like
Truth, Virtue, Honor, Unity, Freedom &c (59·⁶¹)· Famous
men have been deified lor their achievements (62). F inally the
forces oi nature have been personified and natural phenomena
clothed in allegories3 and this has given rise to a great number ol
gods and t'ables relating to them (62-70). It would be in the
highest degree soolish to interpret these literally and to believe'
them; asensible person will rather take them in their true sense,
and regard those gods as nothing more than manifestations os the
divine being working in different parts ol the universe, to whom we
should pay reverence with a true and honest heart.

Next follows the third part or the proof that the world is governed
by the. divine providence. It may be said that this also has been
in some degree anticipated in the preceding portion3 since the crea-
tive and sustaining power, omnipresent in the world, was there
represented as the universal soul and provideuce, endowed with
reason, ordering and governing everything with a definite purpose
(57, 58), but the Stoics thought it necessary to prove this point
independently ol the others, though it obliged them to repeat much
that had been said before. The prooi is ol three sorts. First, if
we once concede the existence ol gods, we must also conceive ol
them as rulers of the world3 because, ii they were not so, they would
not deserve to'be called gods at all. For it follows from the true
general idea of gods that they are subject to po other being external
to themselves3 that they are wise, mutually, bound to a common,
intelligent, systematic activity, and that they must direct this activ-
· ity to the highest and most important object, which is the govern-
ment ol the world (75-80).- The second argumept is drawn from
the order of the universe, and the correspondence ol its parts. All
single objects and parts of the world are subject to Nature, by
which we are to understand no blind aud unconscious force, but one
